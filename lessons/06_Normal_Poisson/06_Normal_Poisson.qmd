## Last time: Discrete vs. continuous random variables

-   Probability distributions are usually either **discrete** or
    **continuous**, depending on whether the random variable is discrete
    or continuous.

## Probabilities for continuous distributions (1/2)

Two important features of continuous distributions:

-   The total area under the density curve is 1.

-   The probability that a variable has a value within a specified
    interval is the area under the curve over that interval.

![](../img_slides/fdicHeightContDistFilled.png){fig-align="center"}

## Probabilities for continuous distributions (2/2)

When working with continuous random variables, probability is found for
**intervals of values** rather than **individual values**.

-   The probability that a continuous r.v. $X$ takes on any single
    individual value is 0

    -   That is, $P(X = x) = 0$.

-   Thus, $P(a < X < b)$ is equivalent to $P(a \leq X \leq b)$

## Normal distribution

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   A random variable X is modeled with a normal distribution if:

    -   **Shape:** symmetric, unimodal bell curve
    -   **Center:** mean $\mu$
    -   **Spread (variability):** standard deviation $\sigma$

 

-   Shorthand for a random variable, $X$, that has a Normal
    distribution: $$X \sim \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma)$$

## Standard Normal Distribution

![Transformation from general normal $X$ to standard normal
$Z$](../img_slides/X_to_Z_transformation_Brase.png){width="5in"}

## Standard Normal Distribution

-   A *standard normal* distribution is defined as a normal distribution
    with mean 0 and variance 1. It is often denoted as $Z \sim N(0, 1)$.

-   Any normal random variable $X$ can be transformed into a standard
    normal random variable $Z$.

$$Z = \dfrac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \qquad X = \mu + Z\sigma$$

-   The $Z$-score of an observation quantifies how far the observation
    is from the mean, in units of standard deviation(s).

-   For example, if an observation has $Z$-score $z = 3.4$, then the
    observation is 3.4 standard deviations above the mean.

## Calculating probabilities from a Normal distribution

Three ways to calculate probabilities from a normal distribution:

1.  Calculus **(not for us!)**

 

2.  Normal probability table

    -   The textbook has a normal probability table in Appendix B.1,
        which is included as the next two pages
    -   Not required for this class

 

3.  R commands

    -   $P(Z \leq q) =$ `pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)`

 

4.  Random online calculators

    -   Like this one:

# Learning Objectives

## Normal Approximation of the Binomial Distribution

-   Recall that a binomial random variable $X$ counts the total number
    of successes in $n$ independent trials, each with probability $p$ of
    a success.
    
 

-   Probability function for $x = 0, 1, ..., n$ :
    $$P(X = k) = {n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$

 

-   Tedious to compute for large number of trails ($n$), although doable
    with software like R

 

-   As $n$ gets big though, the distribution shape of a binomial r.v.
    gets more and more symmetric, and can be approximated by a normal distribution

## Normal Approximation of the Binomial Distribution

-   Also known as: **Sampling distribution of** $\widehat{p}$

-   IF $X\sim \text{Binomial}(n,p)$ and $np>10$ and $nq = n(1-p) > 10$

    -   Ensures sample size ($n$) is moderately large and the $p$ is not
        too close to 0 or 1
    -   Other resources use other criteria (like $npq>5$ or $np>5$)
    -   When looking at a sample, we use $\widehat{p}$ instead of $p$ to
        check this!!

 

-   THEN approximately
    $𝑋\sim \text{Normal}\big(\mu_X = np, \sigma_X = \sqrt{np(1-p)} \big)$

    -   Or we often write this as the sampling distribution of
        $\widehat{p}$:
        $$\widehat{p} \sim \text{Normal}\bigg(\mu_{\widehat{p}} = p, \sigma_{\widehat{p}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{p(1-p)}{n}}\bigg)$$

About 25% of people that test positive for Covid-19 are vaccinated for it. Suppose 100 people have tested positive for Covid-19 (independently of each other). Let $X$ denote the number of people that are vaccinated among the 100 that tested positive. What is the probability that fewer than 20 of the people that tested positive are vaccinated?

1. Exact probability = Binomial distribution

$$X \sim \text{Binomial}(n=100, p=0.25)$$

$$P(X < 20) = P(X \leq 19) = \sum_{j=0}^{19}P(X = j)$$

2. Approximate probability = Normal distribution

    - Mean = $\mu = np = 0.25\cdot 100 = 25$
    - SD = $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}=\sqrt{100\cdot 0.25 \cdot (1-0.25)}$
    
$$X \sim \text{Normal}\bigg(\mu=25, \sigma = \sqrt{100\cdot 0.25 \cdot (1-0.25)}\bigg)$$

- For these probabilities, we use something called a **continuity correction**. Instead of calculating $P(X < 20)$, we calculate $P(X \leq 19.5)$
    
```{r}
pnorm(q = 19.5, mean = 25, 
      sd = sqrt( 100*0.25*0.75 ))

# Learning objectives

## Introduction to the Poisson distribution

-   The Poisson distribution is often used to model **count data (# of
    successes)**, especially for **rare events**

    -   It is a **discrete distribution!**

-   It used most often in settings where events happen at a rate
    $\lambda$ per unit of population and per unit time, such as the
    annual incidence of a disease in a population.

 

-   **Quick example:** for children ages 0 - 14, the incidence rate of
    acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) was approximately 30 diagnosed
    cases per million children per year in 2010.

 

-   Also used to approximate binomial distribution when $n$ is large and
    $p$ is small
    -   When Normal approximation does not work

## Poisson Distribution

Suppose events occur over time in such a way that

1.  The probability an event occurs in an interval is proportional to
    the length of the interval.

2.  Events occur independently at a rate $\lambda$ per unit of time.

Then the probability of exactly $x$ events in one unit of time is $$
P(X = x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{x}}{x!}, \,\, x = 0, 1, 2,
\ldots
$$

The probability of exactly $x$ events $t$ units of time is $$
P(X = x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda t}(\lambda t)^{x}}{x!}, \,\, x = 0, 1,
2, \ldots
$$

For the Poisson distribution modeling the number of events in one unit
of time:

-   The mean is $\lambda$.

-   The standard deviation is $\sqrt{\lambda}$.

In $t$ units of time, the mean and standard deviation are, respectively,
$\lambda t$ and $\sqrt{\lambda t}$.

## Poisson distribution

-   Discrete distribution

-   Used to model count data (# of successes), especially for rare
    events

-   Used to approximate binomial distribution when $n$ is large and $p$
    is small
