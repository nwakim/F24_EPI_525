# Chapter 3: Distributions of Random Variables (Part 2) {#chapter-3-distributions-of-random-variables-part-2 .unnumbered}

*Day 7 topics*:

Section 3.3: Normal distribution Section 3.4: Poisson distribution

## Normal distribution

$\ $

A random variable $X$ is modeled with a normal distribution if:

-   shape: symmetric, unimodal bell curve

-   center: mean $\mu$

-   spread (variability): standard deviation $\sigma$

##

-   Curve is determined by the formula
    $f(x) = \frac{e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}$,
    for $-\infty < x< \infty$.

**The Empirical Rule** (a.k.a. the 68-95-99.7 rule)

For a normal distribution:

-   68% of observations are within one standard deviation (SD) of the
    mean

-   95% are within two SD's

-   99.7% are within three SD's

![Empirical Rule (a.k.a. the 68-95-99.7
rule)](../img_slides/6895997.pdf){#fig:normal width="5in"}

The empirical rule is useful for *estimating* probabilities.

## 

**Standard Normal Distribution**

-   A **standard** normal r.v. has mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

-   We denote standard normal r.v.'s with the letter $Z$.

**Calculating Probabilities for a Standard Normal Distribution**

Three ways to calculate probabilities from a normal distribution:

1.  ~~Calculus~~

2.  Normal probability table

    -   The textbook has a normal probability table in Appendix B.1,
        which is included as the next two pages.

3.  R

    -   $\mathbb{P}(Z\leq q)$ =

            pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)
            
##

::: example
**Example 1**. ***Calculating standard normal probabilities practice**
Let $Z$ be a standard normal random variable, $Z\sim N(\mu=0,\sigma=1)$.
Calculate the following probabilities. Include sketches of the normal
curves with the probability areas shaded in.*

1.  *$\mathbb{P}( Z < 2.67 )$*

2.  *$\mathbb{P}( Z > -0.37 )$*

3.  *$\mathbb{P}( -2.18 < Z < 2.46 )$*

4.  *$\mathbb{P}(Z = 1.53 )$*

**Calculating Probabilities for a General Normal Distribution**

**Example 2**. *Let $X$ be a normal r.v. with mean 8 and standard
deviation 2. Calculate $\mathbb{P}(X>10)$.*

$Z$](../img_slides/X_to_Z_transformation_Brase.png){width="5in"}



## Z-scores

-   The $Z$-score of an observation quantifies how far the observation
    is from the mean, in units of standard deviation(s).

-   For example, if an observation has $Z$-score $z = 3.4$, then the
    observation is 3.4 standard deviations above the mean.

::: example
**Example 3**. ***DBP** Suppose the distribution of diastolic blood
pressure (DBP) in 35- to 44-year old men is normally distributed with
mean 80 mm Hg and variance 144 mm Hg.*

1.  *Mild hypertension is when the DBP is between 90 and 99 mm Hg. What
    proportion of this population has mild hypertension?*

2.  *What is the $10^{th}$ percentile of the DBP distribution?*

3.  *What is the $95^{th}$ percentile of the DBP distribution?*

## Normal approximation of the binomial distribution

-   Recall that a binomial random variable $X$ counts the total number
    of successes in $n$ independent trials, each with probability $p$ of
    a success.

-   Probability function for $x = 0, 1, ..., n$ :
    $$P(X = k) = {n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$

-   Tedious to compute for large number of trails ($n$), although doable
    with software like R.

-   As $n$ gets big though, the distribution shape of a binomial r.v.
    gets more and more symmetric, and can be *approximated by a normal
    distribution*.

$p=0.10$](../img_slides/fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal.pdf){width="5in"}

## 

::: theorem
**Theorem 4**. ***Normal approximation of the binomial distribution**
The binomial distribution with probability of success $p$ is nearly
normal when the sample size $n$ is sufficiently large such that
$np \geq 10$ and $n(1-p)\geq 10$. The approximate normal distribution
has parameters corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of the
binomial distribution: $$\begin{aligned}
\mu &= np
&&\sigma= \sqrt{np(1-p)}
\end{aligned}$$*

::: example
**Example 5**. *[]{#VaccBinom10 label="VaccBinom10"} **Vaccinated people
testing positive for Covid-19 (revisited)** About 25% of people that
test positive for Covid-19 are vaccinated for Covid-19. Suppose 100
people have tested positive for Covid-19 (independently of each other).
Let $X$ denote the number of people that are vaccinated amongst the 100
that tested positive. What is the probability that fewer than 20 of the
people that tested positive are vaccinated?*

## Poisson distribution

-   Discrete distribution

-   Used to model count data (# of successes), especially for rare
    events

-   Used to approximate binomial distribution when $n$ is large and $p$
    is small

##

::: definition
**Definition 6**. *Distribution of a **Poisson** random variable. Let
$X$ be the total number of successes in an interval (such as time) with
an average success rate $\lambda$. Then probability of observing exactly
$k$ successes in a unit interval is*
:::

-   The parameter of a Poisson distribution is $\lambda$.

-   If a r.v. $X$ is modeled by a Poisson distribution, then we write in
    shorthand

with parameter $\lambda$, then*

per year from typhoid fever over a 1-year period.*
