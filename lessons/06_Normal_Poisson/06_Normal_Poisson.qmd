## Last time: Discrete vs. continuous random variables

-   Probability distributions are usually either **discrete** or
    **continuous**, depending on whether the random variable is discrete
    or continuous.

## Probabilities for continuous distributions (1/2)

Two important features of continuous distributions:

-   The total area under the density curve is 1.

-   The probability that a variable has a value within a specified
    interval is the area under the curve over that interval.

![](../img_slides/fdicHeightContDistFilled.png){fig-align="center"}

## Probabilities for continuous distributions (2/2)

When working with continuous random variables, probability is found for
**intervals of values** rather than **individual values**.

-   The probability that a continuous r.v. $X$ takes on any single
    individual value is 0

    -   That is, $P(X = x) = 0$.

-   Thus, $P(a < X < b)$ is equivalent to $P(a \leq X \leq b)$

## Normal distribution

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

-   A random variable X is modeled with a normal distribution if:

    -   **Shape:** symmetric, unimodal bell curve
    -   **Center:** mean $\mu$
    -   **Spread (variability):** standard deviation $\sigma$

 

-   Shorthand for a random variable, $X$, that has a Normal
    distribution: $$X \sim \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma)$$
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](../img_slides/Normal_examples.png)
:::
:::::

  
- **Example:** We recorded the high temperature in the past 100 years for today. The mean high is 19°C (66.2°F)

## Standard Normal distribution (1/2)

-   A *standard normal* distribution is defined as a normal distribution
    with mean 0 and variance 1. It is often denoted as $Z \sim N(0, 1)$.

-   Any normal random variable $X$ can be transformed into a standard
    normal random variable $Z$.

$$Z = \dfrac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \qquad X = \mu + Z\sigma$$

-   The $Z$-score of an observation quantifies how far the observation
    is from the mean, in units of standard deviation(s).

-   For example, if an observation has $Z$-score $z = 3.4$, then the
    observation is 3.4 standard deviations above the mean.

## Calculating probabilities from a Normal distribution

Three ways to calculate probabilities from a normal distribution:

1.  Calculus **(not for us!)**

 

2.  Normal probability table

    -   The textbook has a normal probability table in Appendix B.1,
        which is included as the next two pages
    -   Not required for this class

 

3.  R commands

    -   $P(Z \leq q) =$ `pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)`

 

4.  Random online calculators

    -   Like this one:

## Normal Approximation of the Binomial Distribution

-   Recall that a binomial random variable $X$ counts the total number
    of successes in $n$ independent trials, each with probability $p$ of
    a success.

 

-   Probability function for $x = 0, 1, ..., n$ :
    $$P(X = k) = {n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$

 

-   Tedious to compute for large number of trails ($n$), although doable
    with software like R

 

-   As $n$ gets big though, the distribution shape of a binomial r.v.
    gets more and more symmetric, and can be approximated by a normal
    distribution

-   [Pretty good video behind the intuition of
    this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCqWkJ_pqNU&ab_channel=jbstatistics)
    (Watch 00:00 - 05:40)

## We can look at a plot of Binomial distributions

-   Binomial distributions for different $n$ (columns) and $p$ (rows)

```{r}

p = c(0.1, 0.5)

binom = expand.grid(x = x, n = n, p = p) %>%
  mutate(y = dbinom(x, size = n, prob = p))

ggplot(binom %>% filter(y > 1e-5) %>% 
         group_by(n), 
       aes(x, y, color=factor(n))) +
  geom_point(size=1) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=x, xend=x, y=0, yend=y, color=factor(n)), lwd=0.8, alpha=0.5) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(p), cols = vars(n), scales="free_x", space="free_x") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),    # Axis title size
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),     # Axis text size
        strip.text = element_text(size = 13)) +  # Facet label size
  labs(x = "Number of successes", y = "Probability") +
  scale_color_manual(values = palette_525)
```

## Normal Approximation of the Binomial Distribution

-   Also known as: **Sampling distribution of** $\widehat{p}$

-   If $X\sim \text{Binomial}(n,p)$ and $np>10$ and $nq = n(1-p) > 10$

    -   Ensures sample size ($n$) is moderately large and the $p$ is not
        too close to 0 or 1
    -   Other resources use other criteria (like $npq>5$ or $np>5$)

 

-   THEN approximately
    $$X\sim \text{Normal}\big(\mu_X = np, \sigma_X = \sqrt{np(1-p)} \big)$$

-   **Continuity Correction**: Applied to account for the fact that the
    binomial distribution is discrete, while the normal distribution is
    continuous

    -   Adjust the binomial value (# of successes) by ±0.5 before
        calculating the normal probability.
    -   For $P(X \leq k)$ (Binomial), you would instead calculate
        $P(X \leq k + 0.5)$ (Normal approx)
    -   For $P(X \geq k)$ (Binomial), you would instead calculate
        $P(X \leq k - 0.5)$ (Normal approx)

## Introduction to the Poisson distribution

-   The Poisson distribution is often used to model **count data (# of
    successes)**, especially for **rare events**

    -   It is a **discrete distribution!**

 

-   It is used most often in settings where **events happen at a rate**
    $\lambda$ per unit of population and per unit time

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Example:** historical records of hospitalizations in New York City indicate that an average of 4.4 people are hospitalized each day for an acute myocardial infarction (AMI)

## Poisson distribution

-   Suppose events occur over time in such a way that

    1.  The probability an event occurs in an interval is proportional
        to the length of the interval.

    2.  Events occur independently at a rate $\lambda$ per unit of time.

-   Then the probability of exactly $x$ events in one unit of time is $$
    P(X = k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{k}}{k!}, \,\, k = 0, 1, 2,
    \ldots
    $$

-   For the Poisson distribution modeling the number of events in one
    unit of time:

    -   The mean is $\lambda$.

    -   The standard deviation is $\sqrt{\lambda}$.

-   Shorthand for a random variable, $X$, that has a Poisson
    distribution: $$X \sim \text{Pois}(\lambda)$$

## Example: probabilities from a Poisson distribution (2/4)

::: example
::: ex-ttl
Typhoid fever
:::
::: ex-cont
Suppose there are on average 5 deaths
per year from typhoid fever over a 1-year period.

1.  What is the probability of 3 deaths in a year?
:::
:::

- $\lambda = 5$ and we want $P(X = 3)$

$$P(X=3) = \frac{e^{-5}5^{3}}{3!} = 0.1404$$

```{r}
dpois(x = 3, lambda = 5)
```

## Example: probabilities from a Poisson distribution (3/4)

::: example
::: ex-ttl
Typhoid fever
:::
::: ex-cont
Suppose there are on average 5 deaths
per year from typhoid fever over a 1-year period.

2.  What is the probability of 2 deaths in 0.5 years?

:::
:::

$\lambda = ?$ and we want $P(X = 2)$

- $\lambda=5$ was the rate for one year. When we want the rate for half year, we need to calculate a new $\lambda$: 

    - $\lambda = \dfrac{5 \text{ deaths}}{1 \text{ year}}\cdot\dfrac{1 \text{ year}}{2 \text{ half-years}}=\dfrac{2.5 \text{ deaths}}{1 \text{ half-year}}$

$$P(X=2) = \frac{e^{-2.5}2.5^{2}}{2!} = 0.0.2565$$

```{r}
dpois(x = 2, lambda = 2.5)
```

## Example: probabilities from a Poisson distribution (4/4)

::: example
::: ex-ttl
Typhoid fever
:::
::: ex-cont
Suppose there are on average 5 deaths
per year from typhoid fever over a 1-year period.

3.  What is the probability of more than 12 deaths in 2 years?
:::
:::

$\lambda = ?$ and we want $P(X > 12)$

- Need to calculate a new $\lambda$ for 2 years: $\lambda = \dfrac{5 \text{ deaths}}{1 \text{ year}}\cdot\dfrac{2 \text{ years}}{1 \text{ two-years}}=\dfrac{10 \text{ deaths}}{1 \text{ two-year}}=\dfrac{10 \text{ deaths}}{2 \text{ years}}$

$$P(X>12) = 1 - P(X \leq 12) = 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{12}\frac{e^{-10}10^{k}}{k!} = 0.2084$$

## Poisson approximation of binomial distribution

-   Poisson distribution can be used to approximate binomial distribution when $n$ is large and
    $p$ is small
    -   When Normal approximation does not work

-   Binomial distributions for different $n$ (columns) and $p$ (rows)
