# Nonparametric tests

## Background: parametric vs nonparametric

-   Parametric vs. nonparametric
    -   Basically saying: assuming a distribution for our data vs. not assuming a distribution for our data
-   In all of our inference so far, we have assumed the population (that the data come from) has a specific distribution
    -   Normal distribution, T-distribution, Chi-squared distribution, F-distribution
-   Each of those distribution can be **parameterized** from certain population parameters
    -   For example: Normal distribution is completely described (parameterized) by two parameters: $\mu$ and $\sigma$
-   Our inference and analysis was all based in the assumed distribution
    -   But remember: we have specific assumptions that we need to check in order to use those distributions!
-   **Nonparametric** procedures
    -   Make fewer assumptions about the structure of the underlying population from which the samples were collected
    -   Work well when distributional assumptions are in doubt.

## The good and the bad about nonparametric tests

::::: columns
::: column
**Good**

-   Fewer assumptions
-   Tests are based on ranks
    -   Therefore outliers have no greater influence than non-outliers.
    -   Since tests are based on ranks we can apply these procedures to ordinal data
        -   (where means and standard deviations are not meaningful).
:::

::: column
**Drawbacks**

-   Less powerful than parametric tests (due to loss of information when data are converted to ranks)
-   While the test is easy, it may require substantial (computer) work to develop a confidence interval \[by "inverting" the test\].
-   Theory was developed for continuous data (where ties are not possible); if population or data contain many ties, then a correction to the procedures must be implemented.
-   Some procedures have "large" and "small" sample versions; the small sample versions require special tables or a computer.

## Parametric and nonparametric tests

| Type of data | Parametric test | Nonparametric test |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Single sample, numeric | Single mean hypothesis test or t-test (Lesson 11) | Wilcoxon signed-rank test |
| Paired sample, numeric | Mean difference (paired) hypothesis test or t-test (Lesson 12) | Sign test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test |
| Two independent sample, numeric | Difference in means hypothesis test or two sample t-test (Lesson 13) | Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Mann-Whitney U test |
| Single sample, binary | Single proportion hypothesis test (Lesson 15) |  |
| Two independent sample, binary | Difference in proportions hypothesis test (Lesson 15) |  |
| Two or more independent samples, binary | Chi-squared test (Lesson 16) | Fisher's Exact test |
| Two or more independent samples, numeric | ANOVA test or F-test (Lesson 17) | Kruskal-Wallis test |

## We still follow the general hypothesis test process

1.  Check the [**assumptions**]{style="color:#70AD47"}

    - We will not meet the parametric assumptions!
    - There are some assumptions for the nonparametric tests

2.  Set the [**level of significance**]{style="color:#70AD47"} $\alpha$

3.  Specify the [**null**]{style="color:#70AD47"} ( $H_0$ ) and [**alternative**]{style="color:#70AD47"} ( $H_A$ ) [**hypotheses**]{style="color:#70AD47"}

    -   In symbols
    -   In words
    -   Alternative: one- or two-sided?

4.  Calculate the [**test statistic**]{style="color:#70AD47"} and [**p-value**]{style="color:#70AD47"} for Fisher Exact test in R

    -   We will not discuss the test statistic's equation

5.  Write a [**conclusion**]{style="color:#70AD47"} to the hypothesis test

    -   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
    -   Write a conclusion in the context of the problem

# (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test

For paired data or single samples;\
accounts for sizes of differences

## (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test

-   The (Wilcoxon) signed-rank test is used for
    -   Paired samples (i.e., a single set of differences)
    -   One-sample comparison against a specified value
-   If we want to see if data are symmetric (centered) around a certain value
    - For paired data, we may want to see if the data are symmetric around 0 to determine a difference 
    - For one sample, we may have an idea of a median value that our data may follow
-   Think back to the parametric parallel of these! 
    - If we apply the body temperature example to this: We would check if the data were symmetric around 98.6
- Data do NOT need to be approximately normal

## Example: Intraocular pressure of glaucoma patients

::::: columns
::: column
-   Intraocular pressure of glaucoma patients is often reduced by treatment with adrenaline.
-   A **new synthetic drug** is being considered, but it is more expensive than the **current adrenaline alternative**.
-   7 glaucoma patients were treated with both drugs:
    -   one eye with adrenaline and
    -   the other with the synthetic drug
-   **Reduction in pressure** was recorded in each eye after following treatment (larger numbers indicate greater reduction)
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
IOP_table <- tibble(
  Patient = 1:7,
  Adren = c(3.5, 2.6, 3, 1.9, 2.9, 2.4, 2),
  Synth = c(3.2, 3.1, 3.3, 2.4, 2.9, 2.8, 2.6)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    d = Synth - Adren,
    Sign = case_when(

```

-   **d** is the difference in reduction of pressure: **Synth - Adren**
-   **Sign** is `+` if the difference is positive and `-` if the difference is negative

$H_0:$ the population difference in reduction of intraocular pressure in treatment with adrenaline vs. new synthetic drug is **symmetric around** $\tilde{\mu}_0 =0$\
$H_a:$ the population difference in reduction of intraocular pressure in treatment with adrenaline vs. new synthetic drug is **not symmetric around** $\tilde{\mu}_0 =0$
:::
:::::
::::::
:::::::::::

-   Even if the population has a mean/median equal to $\tilde{\mu}_0$, the test may reject the null if the population isn't symmetric, thus only use if the data (differences) are symmetric.
-   If the population is symmetric
    -   then the mean and median coincide,
    -   thus often the null hypothesis is phrased in terms of the median (or median difference) being 0
    
## Example: Visualize the differences

Visualize the differences in reduction of pressure $d$ : **Synth - Adren**

## Example: Calculate signed ranks

-   Rank the **absolute values** of the differences from smallest to largest
-   For ties, take the average of the highest and lowest tied ranks
    -   I.e. if ranks 3-7 are tied, then assign (3+7)/2 = 5 as the rank
-   Then calculate the **signed ranks** as +/- the rank depending on whether the sign is +/-

```{r}
#| echo: false
IOP_ranks <- IOP %>% 
  mutate(
    Rank = c(1.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, NA, 3, 6),
    Signed_rank = case_when(
      d < 0 ~ -Rank,
      d > 0 ~ Rank
      )
    )
IOP_ranks %>% gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 40)
```

## (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test: Test statistic

- If the null is true:
    -   The population is symmetric around some point ( $\tilde{\mu}_0 = 0$ , typically), and
    -   The **overall size of the positive ranks should be about the same as the overall size of negative ranks**.


-   Note: 
    -   The sum of the ranks (not signed) $1,2,\dotsc, n$ is always $n(n+1)/2$,
    -   which can be broken down as the
        -   sum of the positive ranks ( $T^+$ )
        -   plus the sum of the negative ranks ( $T^-$ )

- Thus, any of the following can be used as a test statistic and will lead to the same conclusion:
    -   $T^+$
    -   $T^-$
    -   $T^+ - T^-$
    -   $\min(T^+,T^−) = T_0$ (our focus)

## Example: calculate sums of signed ranks

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

-   Sum of the positive ranks
    -   $T^+$ = 1.5 + 3 + 4.5 + 4.5 + 6 = 19.5

 

-   Sum of the negative ranks
    -   $T^-$ = -1.5

     

-   The sum of the ranks $1,2,\dotsc, n$ is always $n(n+1)/2$:
    -   $n(n+1)/2 = 6(7)/2 = 21$
    -   $T^+ + |T^-| = 19.5 + |-1.5| = 21$
    
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
IOP_ranks %>% gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 40)
```

:::
:::

## (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test: Exact p-value (fyi)

-   **Exact p-value** is preferable
    -   This is the default method in R's `wilcox.test()`
        -   if the samples contain less than 50 finite values
        -   and **there are no ties**
            -   *R will automatically use normal approximation method if there are ties*
-   *We will not be calculating the exact p-value "by hand." We will be using R for this.*

<hr>

<br>

$$p-value = 2 * P(\min(T^+,T^−) \leq t)$$

-   $t$ is the smaller of the calculated sums of the positive and negative ranks
-   To calculate the exact p-value, we need the probability of each possible sum of ranks

## (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test in R: Glaucoma example

"Attempt" with exact p-value & running one sample test with differences

```{r}
#| warning: false
# Exact p-value
wilcox.test(x = IOP$d, 
		alternative = c("two.sided"), mu = 0, 
		exact = TRUE, correct = TRUE)
```


## (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test: Conclusion

Recall the hypotheses to the (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test:

$H_0:$ the population difference in reduction of intraocular pressure in treatment with adrenaline vs. new synthetic drug is **symmetric around** $\tilde{\mu}_0 =0$\
$H_a:$ the population difference in reduction of intraocular pressure in treatment with adrenaline vs. new synthetic drug is **not symmetric around** $\tilde{\mu}_0 =0$

-   Significance level: $\alpha$ = 0.05
-   p-value = 0.07314
-   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?

 


**Conclusion**:

There is insufficient evidence the differences in reduction in intraocular pressure differs between the synthetic drug and adrenaline are symmetric about 0 (2-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test $p$-value = 0.07314)


## (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test with one sample

-   One can use the (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test when testing just one sample
-   Note that we did this when in R: Ran the (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test using just the differences
-   For one sample, we can specify the null population median value:

$H_0:$ The population median is $m$\
$H_a:$ The population median is NOT $m$

 

**Not-so-real example:** Run (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test for paired data with null $m = 0.7$

```{r}
wilcox.test(x = IOP$d, mu = 0.7, alternative = "two.sided")
```


# Wilcoxon rank-sum test

For two independent samples\
a.k.a Mann-Whitney U test

## Wilcoxon rank-sum test

-   The nonparametric alternative to the two-sample $t$-test

    -   used to analyze two samples selected from separate (independent) populations

-   **Also called the Mann-Whitney U test**

-   Unlike the signed-rank test, there is no need to assume symmetry

-   Necessary **condition** is that the two populations being compared

    -   have the same shape (both right skewed, both left skewed, or both symmetric),
    -   so any noted difference is due to a shift in the median

-   Since they have the same shape, when summarizing the test, we can describe the results in terms of a difference in medians.

**Hypotheses**:

$H_0:$ the two populations have the same median\
$H_a:$ the two populations do NOT have the same median

## Wilcoxon rank-sum test: Calculating test statistic $W$

::: columns
::: {.column width="67%"}
1.  Combine the two samples together (keep track of which observations came from each sample).

2.  Rank the full set of $N=n_1 + n_2$ observations.

    -   If ties exist, assign average ranks to tied values (like signed-rank test)

3.  Sum the ranks corresponding to those observations from the smaller sample.

    -   This is a time-saving step; you could also have used the larger sample.
    -   Call this sum $W$

4.  If $n_1, n_2$ are both less than 10, then use an exact test (can only be done if no ties are present)

    -   Otherwise use the large-sample normal approximation.

In our example, both groups have equal n; choose either for computing W.

$$W_{CPZ}=1+2+3+6+7+8 = 27$$

$$W_{control}=4+5+9+10+11+12 = 51$$

::: 

::: {.column width="33%"}


```{r}
#| echo: false
# CPZdata_long <- CPZdata %>% 
#   pivot_longer(cols = c(control,cap_CPZ), 
#                names_to = "Group",
#                values_to = "Current") %>% 
#   arrange(Current) %>% 
#   mutate(Rank = 1:12)

CPZdata_long = CPZdata2 %>% arrange(Current) %>% 
  mutate(Rank = 1:12)

CPZdata_long %>% gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 37)
```
:::
:::

## Wilcoxon rank-sum test: Exact p-value approach

-   **If** $n_1, n_2$ are both less than 10, then use an exact test,
    -   otherwise use the large-sample normal approximation.
    -   However, exact method can only be done if **no ties** are present
-   p-value is the probability of getting a rank sum $W$ as extreme or more extreme than the observed one.
    -   Multiply the 1-tail probability by 2 for the 2-tailed probability

$$p-value = 2 \cdot P(W_{CPZ} \leq 27)$$

-   To calculate $P(W_{CPZ} \leq 27)$,
    -   we need to enumerate all possible sets ranks for the sample size,\
    -   calculate the sum of ranks for each set of possible ranks,
    -   and then the probability for each sum (assuming each set of ranks is equally likely).

## Wilcoxon rank-sum test: using R

Exact p-value

```{r}
#| warning: true
wilcox.test(Current ~ Group, 
            data = CPZdata2, 
            alternative = c("two.sided"), mu = 0, 
            exact = TRUE) 
```


## Wilcoxon rank-sum test: Conclusion

Recall the hypotheses to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test:

$H_0:$ the control and treated populations have the same median\
$H_a:$ the control and treated populations do NOT have the same median

-   Significance level: $\alpha$ = 0.05
-   p-value = 0.06494
-   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?

 

**Conclusion**:

There is suggestive but inconclusive evidence that the evoked membrane current of dental sensory neurons (in rats) differs between the control group and the group exposed to a mixture of capsaicin plus capsazepine (2-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test $p$-value = 0.06494).

# Fisher's Exact Test

Use this if expected cell counts are too small

## Fisher's Exact Test

-   Only necessary when expected counts in one or more cells is less than 5
-   Given row and column totals fixed, computes exact probability that we observe our data or more extreme data
-   Consider a general 2 x 2 table:

![](../img_slides/fisher_tab.png){fig-align="center"}

-   The exact probability of observing a table with cells (a, b, c, d) can be computed based on the hypergeometric distribution

$$P(a, b, c, d) = \dfrac{(a+b)!\cdot(c+d)!\cdot(a+c)!\cdot(b+d)!}{n!\cdot a!\cdot b!\cdot c!\cdot d!}$$

-   Numerator is fixed and denominator changes

## Some notes on the Fisher's Exact Test

-   This is always a two-sided test
-   There is no test statistic nor CI
-   There is no continuity correction since the hypergeometric distribution is discrete

## Recall our example from Lesson 4 and 16

**Question:** Is there an association between age group and hypertension?

  No_Hypertension = c(11, 9, 2, 22),

# Kruskal-Wallis test

Nonparametric ANOVA test

## Kruskal-Wallis test: nonparametric ANOVA test

-   Recall that an ANOVA tests means from more than 2 groups
-   Conditions for ANOVA include
    -   Sample sizes in each group group are large (each $n \ge 30$),
        -   OR the data are relatively normally distributed in each group
    -   Variability is "similar" in all group groups
-   If these conditions are in doubt, or if the response is ordinal, then the Kruskal-Wallis test is an alternative.

\begin{align}
H_0 &: \text{pop median}_1 = \text{pop median}_2 = ... = \text{pop median}_k\\
\text{vs. } H_A&: \text{At least one pair } \text{pop median}_i \neq \text{pop median}_j \text{ for } i \neq j
\end{align}

-   K-W test is an extension of the (Wilcoxon) rank-sum test to more than 2 groups
    -   With $k=2$ groups, the K-W test is the same as the rank-sum test

## K-W test statistic: $H$ (fyi)

$$H = \frac{12}{{N(N + 1)}} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{R_i^2}{n_i} - 3(N + 1)$$

-   $k$ is the number of groups,
-   $n_i$ is the number of observations in group $i$
-   $N = n_1 + \ldots + n_k$ is the total number of observations across all groups,
-   $R_i$ is the sum of ranks for group $i$

The test statistic $H$ has a Chi-squared distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom:

$$H \sim \chi^2_{k-1}$$

Ranks are calculated similarly to the (Wilcoxon) rank-sum test.

## Ranks for the K-W test

1.  Combine the $k$ samples together (keep track of which observations came from each sample).
2.  Rank the full set of $N = n_1 + \ldots + n_k$ observations.
    -   If ties exist, assign average ranks to the tied values (as with the signed-rank test).
3.  Then sum the ranks within each of the $k$ groups
    -   Label the sums of the ranks for each group as $R_1, \ldots + R_k$.

If $H_0$ is true, we expect the populations to have the same medians, and thus the ranks to be similar as well.

- Does not look like each month has equal variance so we cannot use ANOVA

```{r}
max(Oz_mnth$sd) / min(Oz_mnth$sd)
```

## K-W test in R

```{r}
kruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
```

 

There is sufficient evidence that the median ozone levels are different in at least two months from May - September, 1973 in New York City (p \< 0.001; Kruskal-Wallis test).

-   (fyi) Since the K-W test is significant, follow-up with pairwise (Wilcoxon) rank-sum tests using a multiple comparison procedure to identify which months have different medians.
