## Announcements

-   Would anyone like to join me for a panel?

    -   For PSU's Stem Day on 11/25 right after class

    -   Local high schoolers will be visiting and learning about STEM fields at PSU

-   Creating a video for HW 3 presentations: see homework tab

## Key Dates

-   HW 04 assignment due Friday
-   HW 03 solutions due Sunday (still worth 12 points)
    -   I will select **one problem from this assignment for everyone to make solutions on**
        -   You may still work in a group, but everyone will submit their own solution
        -   It will be on 3.22
        -   I decided this because I thought it would be unfair to have one group member have extra work with this problem
-   HW 03 videos are due on 11/12 at 11pm
    -   Or scheduled meeting with me on the week of 11/11
