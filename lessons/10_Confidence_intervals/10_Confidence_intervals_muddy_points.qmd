## 1. For 95% confidence interval, why are we using p=0.975 rather than using p=0.95?

## 2. Hard time wrapping my head around student's t-distribution, understand use just conceptually why we can use it when pop sd is unknown.

## 3. "The normal distribution doesn’t have a 95% “coverage rate” when using s" I understand that this is the case, but I didn't really understand why.
