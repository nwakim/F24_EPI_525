## What is the tidyverse?

The **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
-   **ggplot2** - data visualisation
-   **dplyr** - data manipulation
-   **tidyr** - tidy data
-   **readr** - read rectangular data
-   **purrr** - functional programming
-   **tibble** - modern data frames
-   **stringr** - string manipulation
-   **forcats** - factors
-   and many more ...

## Tidy data[^1]

![](../img_slides/tidy-data-frame.png)

1.  Each variable must have its own column.

2.  Each observation must have its own row.

3.  Each value must have its own cell.

## Pipe operator (`magrittr`)

-   The pipe operator (`%>%`) allows us to step through sequential functions in the same way we follow if-then statements or steps from instructions

 

::: lob
I want to find my keys, then start my car, then drive to work, then park my car.
:::

 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Nested**

```{r eval = FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), 
           to = "work"))
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Piped**

```{r eval = FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "work") %>%
  park()
```

# Helpful functions for transforming and subsetting 

## Helpful functions for transforming and subsetting 

 

**Data transformation**

-   `rename()`

-   `mutate()`

-   `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`

**Data subsetting**

-   `filter()`

-   `select()`

## New dataset: `dds.discr`

- In the US, individuals with developmental disabilities typically receive services and support from state governments

    - California allocates funds to developmentally disabled residents through the Department of Developmental Services (DDS)

- Dataset `dds.discr`

    - Sample of 1,000 people who received DDS funds (out of a total of ~ 250,000)
    - Data include age, sex, race/ethnicity, and annual DDS financial support per consumer

## Let's look back at the `dds.discr` dataset 

   

-   We will load the data (This is a special case! `dds.discr` is a built-in R dataset)

```{r}
data("dds.discr")
```

-   Now, let's take a glimpse at the dataset:

```{r}
glimpse(dds.discr)
```

## Helpful functions for transforming and subsetting 

 

**Data transformation**

::: lob
-   `rename()`
:::

-   `mutate()`

-   `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`

**Data subsetting**

-   `filter()`

-   `select()`

## `rename()`: one of the first things I usually do

-   I notice that two variables have values that don't necessarily match the variable name

    -   Female and male are not genders ([NIH page on sex and gender](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sex-gender))

    -   "White not Hispanic" combines race and ethnicity into one category ([APA page on race and ethnicity](https://www.apa.org/topics/race-ethnicity))

 

::: lob
I want to rename gender to sex (not sure if assigned at birth or current sex) and rename ethnicity to R_E (race and ethnicity)
:::

## `rename()`: one of the first things I usually do

- `rename()` can change the name of a column

- We use: `data %>% rename(new_col_name = old_col_name) `

```{r}
dds.discr1 = dds.discr %>% 
  rename(SAB = gender, 
         R_E = ethnicity)

glimpse(dds.discr1)
```

## Helpful functions for transforming and subsetting 

 

**Data transformation**

-   `rename()`

::: lob
-   `mutate()`
:::

-   `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`

**Data subsetting**

-   `filter()`

-   `select()`


## `mutate()`: constructing new variables from what you have

-   We can create a new variable from other variables

    - Another way to say it: creates new columns that are functions of existing variables

- We often use it like: 

```{r}
#| eval: false

data %>% mutate(new_variable = some_transformation_of_another_variable)
```

##  `mutate()`: create a new variable from two other variables

::: lob
I want to make a variable that is the ratio of expenditures over age
:::

 

```{r}
dds.discr2 = dds.discr1 %>%
  mutate(exp_to_age = expenditures/age) 

glimpse(dds.discr2)
```

## Recoding a numeric variable into categorical

 

::: lob
Can we recreate `age.cohort` using the `age` varible?
:::

 

```{r}
summary(dds.discr2)
```

## Recoding a numeric variable into categorical (2/2)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- We can integrate other functions into `mutate()`
- For example, `case_when()` is a helpful function for mapping values to a category
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Tidyverse:

```{r}
dds.discr3 <- dds.discr2 %>%
  mutate(
    age.cohort2 = case_when(
          age <= 5 ~ "0-5",
          age <= 12 ~ "6-12", 
          age <= 17 ~ "13-17",
          age <= 21 ~ "18-21",
          age <= 50 ~ "22-50",
          age >= 51 ~ "51+"
    )
  )

```

## Have you noticed that I change the number on `dds.discr`?

- I change the number so that R saves a new dataset
- And I do not overwrite the previous dataset
- Can be annoying, but VERY helpful when you have to go back and change code
- When you run things in real time and troubleshoot, it will be helpful to have different versions of the same dataframe

## Helpful functions for transforming and subsetting 

 

**Data transformation**

-   `rename()`

-   `mutate()`

-   `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`

**Data subsetting**

::: lob
-   `filter()`
:::

-   `select()`

## `filter()`: keep rows that match a condition

-   What if I want to subset the data frame? (keep certain rows of observations)

::: lob
I want to look at the data for people who between 50 and 60 years old
:::

 

```{r}
dds.discr4 = dds.discr3 %>%
  filter(age >= 50 & age <= 60)

glimpse(dds.discr4)
```

## Helpful functions for transforming and subsetting 

 

**Data transformation**

-   `rename()`

-   `mutate()`

-   `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`

**Data subsetting**

-   `filter()`

::: lob
-   `select()`
:::

## `select()`: keep or drop columns using their names and types

-   What if I want to remove or keep certain variables?

::: lob
I want to only have age and expenditure in my data frame
:::

 

```{r}
dds.discr5 = dds.discr2 %>%
  select(age, expenditures)

glimpse(dds.discr5)
```

# If time

## Tidy data[^1]

[^1]: Source: R for Data Science. Grolemund and Wickham.

![](../img_slides/tidy-data-frame.png)

1.  Each variable must have its own column.

2.  Each observation must have its own row.

3.  Each value must have its own cell.

## How do we make our data tidy??

- From a contingency table, we need to create the dataframe using the counts

::: columns
::: {.column width="52%"}

- In Lesson 4, we saw this contingency table:

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Create the table data
hyp_cont <- data.frame(
  Age_Group = c("18-39 yrs", "40-59 yrs", "60+ yrs"),
  Hypertension = c(8836, 42109, 39917),
  No_Hypertension = c(112206, 88663, 21589)
)

# Generate table using kable
kable(hyp_cont, col.names = c("Age Group", "Hypertension", "No Hypertension"), 
      caption = "Table: Contingency table showing hypertension status and age group, in
thousands.")
```
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="43%"}

- And then I magically had it in a new format so I could make this plot:

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Create the table data
hyp_cont <- data.frame(
  Age_Group = c("18-39 years", "40-59 years", "60+ years"),
  Hypertension = c(8836, 42109, 39917),
  No_Hypertension = c(112206, 88663, 21589)
)

hyp_data = pivot_longer(hyp_cont, -Age_Group, names_to = "Hypertension") %>%
  uncount(value)
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(data = hyp_data, 
       aes(x = Age_Group, 
       fill = Hypertension)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill")  
```

## `pivot_*()` functions

![](../img_slides/tidyr-longer-wider.gif){fig-align="center"}

## I used `pivot_longer()` to create tidy data (1/2)

- Note that you won't be required to use `pivot_longer()`

  - I will give you data in a tidy form
  
- Here's the original data frame: 

```{r}
hyp_cont <- data.frame(
  Age_Group = c("18-39 years", "40-59 years", "60+ years"),
  Hypertension = c(8836, 42109, 39917),
  No_Hypertension = c(112206, 88663, 21589) )
```

- Note that I use use `data.frame()` to make a data frame
- Then I can name each column that we saw in the contingency table
- Note that information about hypertension vs no hypertension is split between columns
  - And that we only have 3 rows of data to show all 313320 observations

## I used `pivot_longer()` to create tidy data (2/2)
We need to tell `pivot_longer()`:

- Which column must be repeated (pivoted) (all other columns are not repeating)
- The name of the new column that will contain the old variable names 
- Where the values in each cell under the old variables will go


```{r}
hyp_data1 = pivot_longer(
              data = hyp_cont, 
              cols = -Age_Group,         # columns to pivot
              names_to = "Hypertension", # name of new column for variable names
              values_to = "Counts")     # name of new column for values
hyp_data1
```

## One more step to make it tidy

- Aka we need one more step to make it so every row is an observation
  - In this case, we want each row to represent data from one person
  
```{r}
hyp_data = hyp_data1 %>% uncount(Counts)
head(hyp_data, 10)
```
