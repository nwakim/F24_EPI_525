## From Lesson 2: Example: the frog study[^1]

[^1]: From *Introductory Statistics for the Life and Biomedical Sciences*

In evolutionary biology, parental investment refers to the amount of time, energy, or other resources devoted towards raising offspring.

 

We will be working with the `frog` dataset, which originates from a 2013 study[^2] about maternal investment in a frog species. Reproduction is a costly process for female frogs, necessitating a trade-off between individual egg size and total number of eggs produced.

[^2]: Chen, W., et al. Maternal investment increases with altitude in a frog on the Tibetan Plateau. Journal of evolutionary biology 26.12 (2013): 2710-2715.

    ## 

 

Researchers were interested in investigating how maternal investment varies with altitude. They collected measurements on egg clutches found at breeding ponds across 11 study sites; for 5 sites, the body size of individual female frogs was also recorded.

 

 

## From Lesson 2: Four rows from frog data frame

\captionsetup[table]{labelformat=empty}

```{r echo=FALSE}
data(frog) 
```

|     | altitude | latitude | egg.size | clutch.size | clutch.volume | body.size |
|-----|----------|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1   | 3,462.00 | 34.82    | 1.95     | 181.97      | 177.83        | 3.63      |
| 2   | 3,462.00 | 34.82    | 1.95     | 269.15      | 257.04        | 3.63      |
| 3   | 3,462.00 | 34.82    | 1.95     | 158.49      | 151.36        | 3.72      |
| 150 | 2,597.00 | 34.05    | 2.24     | 537.03      | 776.25        | NA        |

 

-   Each **row** is an [**observation**]{style="color:#BF396F;"}
-   Each **column** is a [**variable**]{style="color:#459B99;"}
-   All the [**observations**]{style="color:#BF396F;"} and [**variables**]{style="color:#459B99;"} together make a [**data frame**]{style="color:#8043F3;"} (sometimes called data matrix)

 

-   **Missing values:** `NA` means the measured value for body size in clutch #150 is missing

## From Lesson 2: Exploring data initially

-   Techniques for exploring and summarizing data **differ** for [**numerical**]{style="color:#E75B5C;"} versus [**categorical**]{style="color:#EF85B3;"} variables.

 

-   Numerical and graphical summaries are useful for examining variables one at a time
    -   Can also be used for exploring the relationships between variables
    -   *Numerical* summaries are not just for [**numerical**]{style="color:#E75B5C;"} variables (certain ones are used for [**categorical**]{style="color:#EF85B3;"} variables)

 

-   Today we we look at ways to **visualize** a [**numerical**]{style="color:#E75B5C;"} variable and a [**categorical**]{style="color:#EF85B3;"} variable

# Learning Objectives

# Visualize numerical variables with `ggplot`

## Histograms

::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
-   Histograms show the counts of observations (y-axis) that have values within a specific interval for a specific variable (x-axis)
-   Show the shape of the distribution and data density
-   Distribution is considered **symmetric** if the trailing parts of the plot are roughly equal
-   Distribution is considered **asymmetric** if one tail trails off more than the other (as we see with clutch volume)
-   Asymmetric distributions are said to be skewed
    -   **Skewed right** if trails off to right
    -   **Skewed left** if trails off to the left
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

:::
:::::

## Histograms

-   Mode is represented by the tallest peak in the distribution
-   When data have one prominent peak, we call it unimodel
-   If there is more than one relative peak, we call it multimodel

![](../img_slides/dist_1.19.png)

## Histograms

We can make a histogram of clutch volume or clutch size:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| fig.height: 7
ggplot(data = frog, 
       aes(x = clutch.volume)) +
  geom_histogram() 
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

#| fig.height: 7
ggplot(data = frog, 
       aes(x = clutch.size)) +
  geom_histogram() 
```

## Poll Everywhere Question 1

## Boxplots

::::: columns
::: {.column width="43%"}
-   A **boxplot** indicates the positions of the first, second, and third quartiles of a distribution in addition to extreme observations
-   Interquartile range (IQR) represented by rectangle with black line through it for the median
-   Whiskers extend from the box to capture data that are between $Q_1$ and $Q_1 - 1.5 IQR$ and separately between $Q_3$ and $Q_3 + 1.5 IQR$
-   An **outlier** is a value that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data
    -   It is more than $1.5IQR$ away from $Q_1$ and $Q_3$

## We may want to transform data

-   When working with strongly skewed data, it can be useful to apply a transformation

-   Common to use the **natural log transformation** on skewed data 
    
    -   We typically just call this the "log transformation"

    -   Especially for variables with many values clustered near 0 and other observations that are positive
    
-   Transformations are mostly used when we make certain assumptions about the distribution of our data
    - For a lot of statistics methods, we assume the data is distributed normally
    - So we may need to transform the data to make it normal!

## Let's transform clutch volume!

## Poll everywhere question 2 

# Visualize categorical data

## From Lesson 4: Example: hypertension prevalence (1/2)

-   US CDC estimated that between 2011 and 2014[^1], 29% of the population in America had hypertension

 

-   A health care practitioner seeing a new patient would expect a 29% chance that the patient might have hypertension
    -   However, this is **only the case if nothing else is known about the patient**

[^1]: <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db220.htm>


## From Lesson 4: Example: hypertension prevalence

- Prevalence of **hypertension varies significantly with age**
    - Among adults aged 18-39, 7.3% have hypertension
    - Adults aged 40-59, 32.2%
    - Adults aged 60 or older, 64.9% have hypertension

 

-   Knowing the age of a patient provides important information about the likelihood of hypertension
    - Age and hypertension status are **not independent** (we will get into this)
    
-   While the probability of hypertension of a randomly chosen adult is 0.29...
    
    -   The **conditional probability** of hypertension in a person known to be 60 or older is 0.649

 

## From Lesson 4: Contingency tables 

- We can start looking at the **contingency table** for hypertension for different age groups
  - **Contingency table:** type of data table that displays the frequency distribution of two or more categorical variables
  
```{r}
#| echo: false

# Create the table data
hyp_data <- data.frame(
  Age_Group = c("18-39 years", "40 to 59 years", "Greater than 60 years", "Total"),
  Hypertension = c(8836, 42109, 39917, 90862),
  No_Hypertension = c(112206, 88663, 21589, 222458),
  Total = c(121042, 130772, 61506, 313320)
)

# Generate table using kable
kable(hyp_data, col.names = c("Age Group", "Hypertension", "No Hypertension", "Total"), 
      caption = "Table: Contingency table showing hypertension status and age group, in
thousands.")
```

## Let's look at each variable separately

- The label "contingency tables" are usually reserved for when we have two variables in one table
- When we have one variable, we often call these **frequency tables**
  - Shows the count of observati

# Case study

## Case Study Description

-   In the US, individuals with developmental disabilities typically receive services and support from state governments.

    -   California allocates funds to developmentally disabled residents through the *Department of Developmental Services (DDS)*
    -   Recipients of DDS funds are referred to as "consumers."

 

-   Dataset `dds.discr`

    -   Sample of 1,000 DDS consumers (out of a total of \~ 250,000)
    -   Data include [age, sex assigned at birth, race/ethnicity, and annual DDS financial support per consumer]{style="color:#C83532"}

 

-   For now, we are going to explore these data with `R`

-   See Section 1.7.1 in the textbook for more details

## Load `dds.discr` dataset from `oibiostat` package

-   The textbook's datasets are in the R package `oibiostat`

-   Make sure the `oibiostat` package is installed before running the code below.

-   Load the `oibiostat` package and the dataset `dds.discr`

 

[**The code below needs to be run *every time* you restart R or render a Qmd file:**]{style="color:#BF396F"}

```{r}
library(oibiostat)
data("dds.discr")
```

 

-   After loading the dataset `dds.discr` using `data("dds.discr")`, you will see `dds.discr` in the Data list of the Environment window.

## `glimpse()`

-   We previously used the base R structure command `str()` to get information about variable types in a dataset (in R03: R basics part 2)
-   Use `glimpse()` from the `tidyverse` package (technically it's from the `dplyr` package) to get information about variable types.
-   `glimpse()` tends to have nicer output for `tibbles` than `str()`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(dds.discr)  # from tidyverse package (dplyr)
```

## Some things to note on this dataset

```{r}
glimpse(dds.discr)  # from tidyverse package (dplyr)
```

-   This happens in older datasets (and honestly some newer ones): gender and sex get conflated
    -   I try to catch these issues before sharing datasets with you, but when we load datasets directly from the `oibiostat` package, I can't make these changes
    -   If you are unfamiliar with the differences, please see [this NIH site on sex and gender](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sex-gender)
-   Also, race and ethnicity can be mislabeled
    -   "White not hispanic" combines race and ethnicity
    -   If you are unfamiliar with the differences, please see [this APA site on race and ethnicity](https://www.apa.org/topics/race-ethnicity)

## `rename()`: one of the first things I usually do

-   I want to rename the variable, gender, to sex and rename ethnicity to r_e (race and ethnicity)

 

```{r}
dds.discr1 = dds.discr %>% 
  rename(sex_MF = gender, 
         r_e = ethnicity)

glimpse(dds.discr1)
```
