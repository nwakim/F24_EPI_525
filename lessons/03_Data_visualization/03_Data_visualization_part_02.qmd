## Case study: discrimination in developmental disability support (1.7.1)

* __Previous research__
  * Researchers examined DDS expenditures for developmentally disabled residents by ethnicity
  * Found that the mean annual expenditures on Hispanics was less than that on White non-Hispanics. 
* __Result__: an allegation of ethnic discrimination was brought against the California DDS.
* __Question: Are the data sufficient evidence of ethnic discrimination?__



## Load `dds.discr` dataset from `oibiostat` package

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
* The textbook's datasets are in the R package `oibiostat`
* Make sure the `oibiostat` package is installed before running the code below.

* Load the `oibiostat` package and the dataset `dds.discr`

__[the code below needs to be run _every time_ you restart R or render a Qmd file]{style="color:darkorange"}__
```{r}
library(oibiostat)
data("dds.discr")
```

* After loading the dataset `dds.discr` using `data("dds.discr")`, you will see `dds.discr` in the Data list of the Environment window.
:::


## `glimpse()`

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
__New: `glimpse()`__

* Use `glimpse()` from the `tidyverse` package (technically it's from the `dplyr` package) to get information about variable types. 
* `glimpse()` tends to have nicer output for `tibbles` than `str()`
:::
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(dds.discr)  # from tidyverse package (dplyr)
```

## Mean annual DDS expenditures by race/ethnicity: default long format

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3,5"
mean_expend <- 
  dds.discr_Hips_WhnH %>% 
  group_by(
    ethnicity, age.cohort)%>% 
  summarize(
    ave = mean(expenditures))

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3-5"
mean_expend_wide <- 
  mean_expend %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = ethnicity,

mean_expend_wide <- mean_expend_wide %>% 
  mutate(diff_mean = `White not Hispanic` - Hispanic)

__Question__: Are the data sufficient evidence of ethnic discrimination in DDS expenditures when comparing Hispanics with White non-Hispanics?

## Simpson’s paradox

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
* This case study is an example of __confounding__ known as Simpson’s paradox

* __Simpson’s paradox__ happens when an association observed in several groups disappears or reverses direction when the groups are combined. 

* In other words, an association between two variables $X$ and $Y$ may disappear or reverse direction once data are partitioned into subpopulations based on a third variable $Z$ (i.e., a confounding variable).

# The tidyverse

## Tools for wrangling data

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
- `tidyverse` functions
    + `tidyverse` is a [suite of packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) that implement `tidy` methods for data importing, cleaning, wrangling, and visualizing
    + load the `tidyverse` packages by running the code `library(tidyverse)` 
        * Don't forget to first install `tidyverse`!

- Functions to easily work with rows and columns, such as
    + subset rows/columns
    + add new rows/columns
    + join together different data sets
    + make data _long_ or _wide_

- There are often many steps to tidy data
    + we string together commands 
    + to be performed sequentially 
    + using pipes `%>%`
:::


## Summary of data wrangling so far

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
* The pipe `%>%` to string together commands in sequence
* `mutate()` to add a new variable to a dataset
* `select()` to select columns (or deselect columns with -variable)
* `filter()` to select specific rows
* `pivot_wider()` to reshape a dataset from a long to a wide format

__Summarizing data__

* `tabyl()` from `janitor` package to make frequency tables of categorical variables
* `summarize()` to get summary statistics of variables
* `group_by()` to group data by categorical variables before finding summaries
:::

## What packages are included in the `tidyverse`? {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
__Core packages__  
These automatically load when loading the tidyverse package

![[https://www.tidyverse.org/](https://www.tidyverse.org/)](/img_slides/tidyverse_core.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}

List of all packages:

```{r}
tidyverse_packages(include_self = TRUE)
```

* Packages not a part of the core get installed with the tidyverse suite, but need to be loaded separately.  
* See [https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) for more info.
