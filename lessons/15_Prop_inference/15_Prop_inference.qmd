## Goals for today (Sections 8.1-8.2)

* Statistical inference for a single proportion or the difference of two (independent) proportions
    1. Sampling distribution for a proportion or difference in proportions
    
    1. What are $H_0$ and $H_a$?
    
    1. What are the SE's for $\hat{p}$ and $\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2$?
    
    1. Hypothesis test
    
    1. Confidence Interval
    
    1. How are the SE's different for a hypothesis test & CI?
    
    1. How to run proportions tests in R
    
    1. Power & sample size for proportions tests (extra material)



## Motivating example

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

__One proportion__

* A 2010 study found that out of 269 male college students, 35% had participated in sports betting in the previous year. 
    * What is the CI for the proportion?
    * The study also reported that 36% of noncollege young males had participated in sports betting. Is the proportion for male college students different from 0.36?

__Two proportions__

* There were 214 men in the sample of noncollege young males (36% participated in sports betting in the previous year).
* Compare the difference in proportions between the college and noncollege young males.
    * CI & Hypothesis test

## Steps in a Hypothesis Test

1. Set the __[level of significance]{style="color:darkorange"}__ $\alpha$

1. Specify the __[null]{style="color:darkorange"}__ ( $H_0$ ) and __[alternative]{style="color:darkorange"}__ ( $H_A$ ) __[hypotheses]{style="color:darkorange"}__
    1. In symbols
    1. In words
    1. Alternative: one- or two-sided?

1. Calculate the __[test statistic]{style="color:darkorange"}__. 

1. Calculate the __[p-value]{style="color:darkorange"}__ based on the observed test statistic and its sampling distribution

1. Write a __[conclusion]{style="color:darkorange"}__ to the hypothesis test
    1. Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
    1. Write a conclusion in the context of the problem


## Step 2: Null & Alternative Hypotheses 

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
Null and alternative hypotheses in __words__ and in __symbols__.

::: {.column width="49%"}
__One sample test__

* $H_0$: The population proportion of young male college students that participated in sports betting in the previous year is 0.36.

* $H_A$: The population proportion of young male college students that participated in sports betting in the previous year is not 0.36.

\begin{align}
H_0:& p = 0.36\\
H_A:& p \neq 0.36\\
\end{align}

:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}
__Two samples test__

* $H_0$: The difference in population proportions of young male college and noncollege students that participated in sports betting in the previous year is 0.

* $H_A$: The difference in population proportions of young male college and noncollege students that participated in sports betting in the previous year is not 0.

\begin{align}
H_0:& p_{coll} - p_{noncoll} = 0\\
H_A:& p_{coll} - p_{noncoll} \neq 0\\
\end{align}

:::
:::

:::


## Sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ 

* $\hat{p}=\frac{X}{n}$ where $X$ is the number of "successes" and $n$ is the sample size.
* $X \sim Bin(n,p)$, where $p$ is the population proportion.
* For $n$ "big enough", the normal distribution can be used to approximate a binomial distribution:

$$Bin(n,p) \rightarrow N\Big(\mu = np, \sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} \Big)$$

* Since $\hat{p}=\frac{X}{n}$ is a linear transformation of $X$, we have for large n: 

$$\hat{p} \sim N\Big(\mu_{\hat{p}} = p, \sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \Big)$$

* [*How we apply this result to CI's and test statistics is different!!!*]{style="color:purple"}



## Step 3: Test statistic 

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}

Sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ if we assume $H_0: p=p_0$ is true:

$$\hat{p} \sim N\Big(\mu_{\hat{p}} = p, \sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \Big) 
\sim N\Big(
\mu_{\hat{p}}=p_0, \sigma_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{\frac{p_0\cdot(1-p_0)}{n}}
\Big)$$


Test statistic for a one sample proportion test:

$$
\text{test stat} = \frac{\text{point estimate}-\text{null value}}{SE}
= z_{\hat{p}} = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0\cdot(1-p_0)}{n}}}
$$

## Step 5: Conclusion to hypothesis test

\begin{align}
H_0:& p = 0.36\\
H_A:& p \neq 0.36\\
\end{align}

* Recall the $p$-value = 0.7182897
* Use $\alpha$ = 0.05.
* Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?

__Conclusion statement__:

* Stats class conclusion
    * There is insufficient evidence that the (population) proportion of young male college students that participated in sports betting in the previous year is different than 0.36 ( $p$-value = 0.72).

* More realistic manuscript conclusion: 
    * In a sample of 269 male college students, 35% had participated in sports betting in the previous year, which is not different from 36% ( $p$-value = 0.72).

# Inference for difference of two independent proportions <br> $\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2$

## Sampling distribution of $\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2$ 

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

* $\hat{p}_1=\frac{X_1}{n_1}$ and $\hat{p}_2=\frac{X_2}{n_2}$, 
    * $X_1$ & $X_2$ are the number of "successes"
    * $n_1$ & $n_2$ are the sample sizes of the 1st & 2nd samples 

<br>

* Each $\hat{p}$ can be approximated by a normal distribution, for "big enough" $n$
* Since the difference of independent normal random variables is also normal, it follows that for "big enough" $n_1$ and $n_2$ 

$$\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 \sim N \Big(\mu_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = p_1 - p_2, ~~
\sigma_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} =
\sqrt{
\frac{p_1\cdot(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2\cdot(1-p_2)}{n_2}}

## Step 3: Test statistic (1/2)

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

Sampling distribution of $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$:

\sqrt{
\frac{p_1\cdot(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2\cdot(1-p_2)}{n_2}} 
\Big)$$

Since we assume $H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0$ is true, we "pool" the proportions of the two samples to calculate the SE:

$$\text{pooled proportion} = \hat{p}_{pool} = \dfrac{\text{total number of successes} }{ \text{total number of cases}} = \frac{x_1+x_2}{n_1+n_2}$$ 


Test statistic:

$$
\text{test statistic} = z_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = \frac{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_{pool}\cdot(1-\hat{p}_{pool})}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_{pool}\cdot(1-\hat{p}_{pool})}{n_2}}}

\begin{align}
H_0:& p_{coll} - p_{noncoll} = 0\\
H_A:& p_{coll} - p_{noncoll} \neq 0\\

* Recall the $p$-value = 0.812851
* Use $\alpha$ = 0.05.
* Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?

__Conclusion statement__:

* Stats class conclusion
    * There is insufficient evidence that the difference in (population) proportions of young male college and noncollege students that participated in sports betting in the previous year are different ( $p$-value = 0.81).

* More realistic manuscript conclusion: 
    * 35% of young male college students (n=269) and 36% of noncollege young males (n=214) participated in sports betting in the previous year ( $p$-value = 0.81).

## __Power__ calculation for testing one proportion

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
Conversely, we can calculate how much power we had in our example given the sample size of 269.

* [__Calculate power__]{style="color:green"}, 
    * given $\alpha$, $n$, "true" alternative proportion $p$, and null $p_0$
    
$$1-\beta=
			\Phi\left(z-z_{1-\alpha/2}\right)+\Phi\left(-z-z_{1-\alpha/2}\right)
			\quad ,\quad \text{where } z=\frac{p-p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}$$

$\Phi$ is the probability for a standard normal distribution 

```{r}
p <- 0.35; p0 <- 0.36; alpha <- 0.05; n <- 269
(z <- (p-p0)/sqrt(p*(1-p)/n))

(Power <- pnorm(z - qnorm(1-alpha/2)) +  pnorm(-z - qnorm(1-alpha/2)))
```

If the population proportion is 0.35 instead of 0.36, we only have a 6.4% chance of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when the sample size is 269.
