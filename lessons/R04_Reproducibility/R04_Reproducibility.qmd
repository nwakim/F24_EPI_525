## Where are we?

![](../img_slides/course_map.png){fig-align="center"}

## Using OneDrive

-   We all have free access to OneDrive to store files

-   [Let's login](https://login.microsoftonline.com/) into our online accounts

-   [You can also download OneDrive for your desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/download)

    -   Allows you to access the OneDrive from your computer's interface instead of the browser

    -   Creates a link between your computer and the cloud!

-   Let me show you mine

    -   I can access all the files through RStudio as well!

-   Let's take a couple minutes to log into OneDrive

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(5)
```

## Folder organization

-   Make a folder for our class!
    -   I suggest naming it something like `EPI_525_F24` to indicate the class and the term
-   Make these folders in your computer

    -   Only make them in OneDrive **if** you have a desktop connection

::: columns
::: column
-   For a project, I have the following folders

    -   Background
    -   Code
    -   Data_Raw
    -   Data_Processed
    -   Dissemination
    -   Reports
    -   Meetings
:::

::: column
-   For our class, I suggest making one folder for the course with the following folders in it:

    -   Data
    -   Homework
    -   Lessons
    -   R_activities
    -   And other folders if you want
:::
:::

-   Take a few minutes to create these folders

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(5)
```

## Aside: folder and file naming

There are a few good practices for naming files and folders for easy tracking:

1. Keep the name short and relevant
2. Use leading numbers to help organize sequential items
    - I can show you my lessons folders as an example 
3. Use dates in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" so that files are in chronological order
4. You can label different versions if you would like to 
5. Use "_" to separate sections of the name
    - I also use this to separate words, but some people say you should use "-" to separate words

## Let's go into `R_activities`

- Make a folder called something like `R04_work`

- We are going to stay in the `R_activities` folder

- Now that we have some folders in order, we can start creating a project

## Creating project in RStudio

-   Way to designate a working directory: basically your home base when working in R

    -   We have to tell R exactly where we are in our folders and where to find other things

    -   A project makes it easier to tell R where we are

-   Basic steps to create a project

    -   Go into RStudio

    -   Create new project for this class (under `File` or top right corner)
        
        - I would chose "Existing Directory" since we have already set up our folders
        - Make the new project in the `EPI_525_F24` folder

-   Once we have projects, we can open one and R will automatically know that its location is the start of our working directory

## The nice thing about R projects

- 5 minute video explaining some of the nice features of R projects

## Reproducibility

- Research data and code can reach the same results regardless of who is running the code

  - This can also refer to future or past you!
  
- We want to set up our work so the entire folder can be moved around and work in its new location

## Nicky's process for R projects

-   Let me show you my process

    -   I will create one in my Sample_folder

    -   I will show you how I switch between classes
    
- Make a project file in your class folder!

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(5)
```

## If time, we will move to R05: Intro to Quarto!
