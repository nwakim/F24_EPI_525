## Where are we?

![](../img_slides/course_map.png){fig-align="center"}

## Last time

-   We looked at inference for a **single proportion**
-   We looked at inference for a difference in **two independent proportions**

 

-   If there are two groups, we could see if they had different proportions by testing if the difference between the proportions were the same (null) or different (alternative, two-sided, $\neq$)

 

-   What happens when we want to compare two **or more** groups' proportions?

    -   Can no longer rely on the difference in proportions
    -   Need a new method to make inference (Chi-squared test!)

## From Lesson 4: Example: hypertension prevalence (1/2)

-   US CDC estimated that between 2011 and 2014[^1], 29% of the population in America had hypertension

[^1]: <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db220.htm>

 

-   A health care practitioner seeing a new patient would expect a 29% chance that the patient might have hypertension
    -   However, this is **only the case if nothing else is known about the patient**

## From Lesson 4: Example: hypertension prevalence (2/2)

-   Prevalence of **hypertension varies significantly with age**
    -   Among adults aged 18-39, 7.3% have hypertension
    -   Adults aged 40-59, 32.2%
    -   Adults aged 60 or older, 64.9% have hypertension

 

-   Knowing the age of a patient provides important information about the likelihood of hypertension

    -   Age and hypertension status are **not independent** - **Can we back up this claim??**

-   While the probability of hypertension of a randomly chosen adult is 0.29...

    -   The **conditional probability** of hypertension in a person known to be 60 or older is 0.649

 

::: lob
**Question:** Is there an association between age group and hypertension?
:::

## From Lesson 4: Contingency tables

-   We can start looking at the **contingency table** for hypertension for different age groups
    -   **Contingency table:** type of data table that displays the frequency distribution of two or more categorical variables

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Create the table data
hyp_data <- data.frame(
  Age_Group = c("18-39 yrs", "40-59 yrs", "60+ yrs", "Total"),
  Hypertension = c(8836, 42109, 39917, 90862),
  No_Hypertension = c(112206, 88663, 21589, 222458),
  Total = c(121042, 130772, 61506, 313320)
)

# Generate table using kable
kable(hyp_data, col.names = c("Age Group", "Hypertension", "No Hypertension", "Total"), 
      caption = "Table: Contingency table showing hypertension status and age group, in
thousands.")
```

## $H_0$: Variables are Independent (under the null)

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="48.5%"}
-   Recall from Chapter 2, that events $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if

$$P(A \cap B)=P(A)P(B)$$

-   If age and hypertension are independent variables, then *theoretically* this condition needs to hold for *every combination of levels*, i.e.

\begin{align}
P(18-39 \cap \text{hyp}) &= P(18-39)P(\text{hyp})\\
P(18-39 \cap \text{no hyp}) &= P(18-39)P(\text{no hyp})\\
P(40-59 \cap \text{hyp}) &= P(40-59)P(\text{hyp})\\
P(40-59 \cap \text{no hyp}) &= P(40-59)P(\text{no hyp})\\
P(60+ \cap \text{hyp}) &= P(60+)P(\text{hyp})\\
P(60+ \cap \text{no hyp}) &= P(60+)P(\text{no hyp})\\
\end{align}

#| echo: false
# Generate table using kable
kable(hyp_data, col.names = c("Age Group", "Hypertension", "No Hypertension", "Total")) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 28)
```

\begin{align}
P(18-39 \cap \text{hyp}) &= \frac{121042}{313320}\cdot\frac{90862}{313320}\\
 & ...\\
P(60+ \cap \text{no hyp}) &=\frac{61506}{313320}\cdot\frac{222458}{313320}
\end{align}

With these probabilities, for each cell of the table we calculate the **expected** counts for each cell under the $H_0$ hypothesis that the variables are independent
:::
::::::

## Expected counts (if variables are independent)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   The expected counts (if $H_0$ is true & the variables are independent) for each cell are
    -   $np = \text{total table size} \cdot \text{probability of cell}$
    -   $\text{expected count} = \dfrac{\text{column total}\cdot \text{row total}}{\text{table total}}$

Expected count of 40-59 years old and hypertension:

\begin{align}
\text{expected count} &= \dfrac{\text{column total}\cdot \text{row total}}{\text{table total}} \\
&= \dfrac{\text{90862}\cdot \text{130772}}{\text{313320}} \\ 
&= `r format(90862 * 130772 / 313320, scientific=F)`
\end{align}

#| echo: false
# Generate table using kable
kable(hyp_data, col.names = c("Age Group", "Hypertension", "No Hypertension", "Total")) %>%

```

 

-   If age group and hypertension are **independent** variables
    -   (as assumed by $H_0$),
-   then the **observed counts should be close to the expected counts** for each cell of the table

Expected count for cell $i,j$ :

$$\textrm{Expected Count}_{\textrm{row } i,\textrm{ col }j}=\frac{(\textrm{row}~i~ \textrm{total})\cdot(\textrm{column}~j~ \textrm{total})}{\textrm{table total}}$$

## Poll Everywhere Question 2

## Using R for expected cell counts

-   R calculates expected cell counts using the `expected()` function in the `epitools` package

-   Make sure dataset is in `matrix` form using `as.matrix()`

```{r}
hyp_data2
```

 

 

```{r}
library(epitools)
expected(hyp_data2)
```

## Reference: Steps in a Hypothesis Test

1.  Check the [**assumptions**]{style="color:#3070BF"}

2.  Set the [**level of significance**]{style="color:#3070BF"} $\alpha$

3.  Specify the [**null**]{style="color:#3070BF"} ( $H_0$ ) and [**alternative**]{style="color:#3070BF"} ( $H_A$ ) [**hypotheses**]{style="color:#3070BF"}

    1.  ~~In symbols~~
    2.  In words
    3.  ~~Alternative: one- or two-sided?~~

4.  Calculate the [**test statistic**]{style="color:#3070BF"}.

5.  Calculate the [**p-value**]{style="color:#3070BF"} based on the observed test statistic and its sampling distribution

6.  Write a [**conclusion**]{style="color:#3070BF"} to the hypothesis test

    1.  Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
    2.  Write a conclusion in the context of the problem

## Step 1: Check assumptions

-   **Independence**
    -   All individuals are independent from one another
        -   In particular, observational units cannot be represented in more than one cell
        -   For example, someone cannot be in two differnt age groups

::::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   **Sample size**
    -   In order for the distribution of the test statistic to be appropriately modeled by a chi-squared distribution we need
    -   [2 $\times$ 2 table]{style="color:#367B79"}
        -   expected counts are at least 10 for each cell
    -   [Larger tables]{style="color:#367B79"}
        -   No more than 20% of expected counts are less than 5
        -   All expected counts are greater than 1
:::


::: {.column width="45%"}

 

 

 

```{r}
expected(hyp_data2)
```

All expected counts \> 5
:::
:::::

## Step 2 and 3: Significance level and Hypotheses

- Set $\alpha = 0.05$

 

::::: pink
::: pink-ttl
Hypotheses test for example
:::

::: pink-cont
Test of "**association**" wording

-   $H_0$: There is no association between age and hypertension

-   $H_A$: There is an association between age and hypertension

Test of "**independence**" wording

-   $H_0$: The variables age and hypertension are independent

-   $H_A$: The variables age and hypertension are not independent
:::
:::::

## Step 4: Calculate the $\chi^2$ test statistic (1/2)


Test statistic for a test of association (independence):

$$\chi^2 = \sum_{\textrm{all cells}} \frac{(\textrm{observed} - \text{expected})^2}{\text{expected}}$$

-   When the variables are independent, the observed and expected counts should be close to each other


## Step 4: Calculate the $\chi^2$ test statistic (2/2)

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
\begin{align}
\chi^2 =&  \sum\frac{(O-E)^2}{E} \\
=& \frac{(8836-35101.87)^2}{35101.87} + \frac{(112206-85940.13)^2}{85940.13} + \\
& \ldots + \frac{(21589-43669.42)^2}{43669.42} \\
=&  66831
\end{align}

Is this value big? Big enough to reject $H_0$?
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
Observed:
```{r}
#| echo: false

hyp_data2 %>% # expected() %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Age Group", "Hypertension", "No Hypertension")) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 35)
```

 

Expected:
```{r}
#| echo: false

hyp_data2 %>% expected() %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Age Group", "Hypertension", "No Hypertension")) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 35)
```

:::
:::::

## Poll Everywhere Question 2

## Step 5: Calculate the *p*-value

::::: columns
::: {.column width="59%"}
The $\chi^2$ distribution shape depends on its degrees of freedom

-   It's skewed right for smaller df,
    -   gets more symmetric for larger df
-   [**df = (# rows-1) x (# columns-1)**]{style="color:#C83532"}

![](../img_slides/chisq_density.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="1%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   The [**p-value**]{style="color:darkorange"} is always the [**area to the right**]{style="color:darkorange"} of the test statistic for a $\chi^2$ test

 

-   We can use the `pchisq` function in R to calculate the probability of being at least as big as the $\chi^2$ test statistic:

```{r}
pv <- pchisq(66831, df = 2, 
       lower.tail = FALSE)
pv
```

:::
:::::

## Step 4-5: Calculate the test statistic and p-value 

::: columns
::: column
- Data need to be in a matrix or table: use `as.matrix()` or `table()`
  - Use matrix if data already in contingency table form
  - Use table if data are two columns with each row for each observation (tidy version)
- Notice that age groups are rownames! Age does not have its own column
:::

::: column

```{r}
hyp_data2
```
:::
:::

- Run `chisq.test()` in R
```{r}
chisq.test(x = hyp_data2)
```

## Step 6: Conclusion

Recall the hypotheses to our $\chi^2$ test:

-   $H_0$: There is **no association** between age and hypertension

-   $H_A$: There is **an association** between age and hypertension

 

::: columns
::: column
-   Recall the $p$-value = `r round(0.04022, 4)`
-   Use $\alpha$ = 0.05
-   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
:::
::: column
__Conclusion statement__:

* There is sufficient evidence that there is an association between age group and hypertension (p-value < 0.0001`)
:::
:::

::: blue
::: blue-ttl
Warning!!
:::
::: blue-cont
If we fail to reject, we DO NOT say variables are independent! We **can** say that we have insufficient evidence that there is an association. 
:::
:::

## Chi-squared test: Example all together

::::: columns
::: column
1.  Check expected cell counts threshold

```{r}
expected(hyp_data2)
```

All expected cells are greater than 5.

2.  $\alpha = 0.05$

3.  Hypothesis test:

    -   $H_0$ : There is no association between age group and hypertension
    -   $H_1$ : There is an association between age group and hypertension
:::

::: column
4-5.  Calculate the test statistic and p-value for Chi-squared test in R

```{r}
chisq.test(x = hyp_data2)
```

6.  Conclusion

We reject the null hypothesis that age group and hypertension are not associated ($p<2.2\cdot10^{-16}$). There is sufficient evidence that age group and hypertension are associated.
