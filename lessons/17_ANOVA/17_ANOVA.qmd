## Where are we?

![](../img_slides/course_map.png){fig-align="center"}


## A little while ago...

-   We looked at inference for a **single mean**
-   We looked at inference for a difference in **means from two independent samples**

 

-   If there are two groups, we could see if they had different means by testing if the difference between the means were the same (null) or different (alternative)

 

-   What happens when we want to compare two **or more** groups' means?

    -   Can no longer rely on the difference in means
    -   Need a new method to make inference (ANOVA or Linear Regression!)

## From Lesson 8: Data visualization

- Study investigating whether ACTN3 genotype at a particular location (residue 577) is associated with change in muscle function

 

- **Categorical variable:** genotypes (CC, TT, CT)

 

- **Numeric variable:** Muscle function, measured as percent change in non-dominant arm strength

 

- We can start the investigation by plotting the relationship

## From Lesson 8: Side-by-side boxplots with data points

- We can look at the boxplot of percent change for each genotype **with points shown so we can see the distribution of observations better**

## ANOVA table to hypothesis test?

- Okay, so how do we use all these types of variability to run a test? 
- How do we determine, statistically, if the groups have different means or not?

![](../img_slides/anova_table.png){fig-align="center"}

- Answer: We use the F-statistic in a hypothesis test!

# Learning Objectives

1. Revisit data visualization for a numeric outcome and categorical variable (from Lesson 8).

2. Understand the different measures of variability within an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) table.

::: lob
3. Understand the F-statistic and F-distribution that is used to measure the ratio of between group and within group variability. 
:::

4.  Determine if groups of means are different from one another using a hypothesis test and F-distribution.

## Thinking about the F-statistic

::: columns
::: {.column width="49.5%"}
__[If the groups are actually different, then which of these is more accurate?]{style="color:#C83532"}__

1. **The variability between groups should be higher than the variability within groups**
1. The variability within groups should be higher than the variability between groups

:::

::: {.column width="1%"}
:::

::: {.column width="49.5%"}
__[If there really is a difference between the groups, we would expect the F-statistic to be which of these: ]{style="color:#C83532"}__

1. **Higher than we would observe by random chance**
1. Lower than we would observe by random chance

:::
:::

![](../img_slides/hypothetical_disability_data_v2.png){fig-align="center"}


## The F-statistic

- F-statistic represents the standardized ratio of variability between groups to the variability within the groups

$$F_{stat} = \dfrac{MSG}{MSE}$$

- F is larger when the variability between groups is larger than variability within groups


## The F-distribution

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}

* The F-distribution is skewed right
* The F-distribution has __[two different degrees of freedom]{style="color:#BF396F"}__:
    * one for the [numerator]{style="color:#BF396F"} of the ratio [(k – 1)]{style="color:#BF396F"} and 
    * one for the [denominator (N – k)]{style="color:#BF396F"}

* [$p$-__value__]{style="color:#459B99"}  
    * $P(F > F_{stat})$
    * is always the __[upper tail]{style="color:#459B99"}__
    * (the area as extreme or more extreme)

## Reference: Steps in a Hypothesis Test

1.  Check the [**assumptions**]{style="color:#3070BF"}

2.  Set the [**level of significance**]{style="color:#3070BF"} $\alpha$

3.  Specify the [**null**]{style="color:#3070BF"} ( $H_0$ ) and [**alternative**]{style="color:#3070BF"} ( $H_A$ ) [**hypotheses**]{style="color:#3070BF"}

    1.  In symbols
    2.  In words
    3.  ~~Alternative: one- or two-sided?~~

4.  Calculate the [**test statistic**]{style="color:#3070BF"}.

5.  Calculate the [**p-value**]{style="color:#3070BF"} based on the observed test statistic and its sampling distribution

6.  Write a [**conclusion**]{style="color:#3070BF"} to the hypothesis test

    1.  Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
    2.  Write a conclusion in the context of the problem

## Step 1: Check assumptions

The sampling distribution is an __F-distribution__, if...

- Sample sizes in each group group are large (each $n \ge 30$) 
    * OR the data are relatively normally distributed in each group
- Variability is "similar" in all group groups:
    * Is the within group variability about the same for each group?
    * As a rough rule of thumb, this condition is _violated if the standard deviation of one group is more than double the standard deviation of another group_

## Step 1: Check assumptions

- Use R to check both assumptions in our example

```{r}
genotype_groups <- famuss %>% 
  group_by(actn3.r577x) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(), 
            SD = sd(ndrm.ch))
genotype_groups
```

- Counts in each group are greater than 30!

```{r}
max(genotype_groups$SD) / min(genotype_groups$SD)
```

- Variability in one group vs. another is no more than 1.2 times!

## Step 3: Specify Hypotheses

::::::::::: columns
:::::: column
::::: blue
::: blue-ttl
General hypotheses
:::

::: blue-cont
To test for a difference in means across _k_ groups:

\begin{align}
H_0 &: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_k\\
\text{vs. } H_A&: \text{At least one pair } \mu_i \neq \mu_j \text{ for } i \neq j
\end{align}
:::
:::::
::::::

:::::: column
::::: pink
::: pink-ttl
Hypotheses test for example
:::

::: pink-cont
\begin{align}
H_0 &: \mu_{CC} = \mu_{CT} = \mu_{TT}\\
\text{vs. } H_A&: \text{At least one pair } \mu_i \neq \mu_j \text{ for } i \neq j
\end{align}
:::
:::::
::::::
:::::::::::

## Step 4-5: Find the test statistic and p-value

- Our test statistic is an F-statistic
    - F-statistic: measurement of the ratio of variability between groups to variability within groups

 

- Our F-statistic follows an F-distribution
    - Which is why we cannot use something like the Z-distribution nor T-distribution
    
 

- So we'll need to find the F-statistic and its corresponding p-value using an F-distribution
    

## Step 4-5: Find the test statistic and p-value

* There are several options to run an ANOVA model (aka calculate F-statistic and p-value)
* Two most common are `lm` and `aov`
    * `lm` = linear model; will be using frequently in BSTA 512

::: columns
::: column
```{r}
lm(ndrm.ch ~ actn3.r577x, 
    data = famuss) %>% anova()
```
:::

::: column
```{r}
aov(ndrm.ch ~ actn3.r577x, 
    data = famuss) %>% summary()
```
:::
:::

## Step 6: Conclusion

\begin{align}
H_0 &: \mu_{CC} = \mu_{CT} = \mu_{TT}\\
\text{vs. } H_A&: \text{At least one pair} \mu_i \neq \mu_j \text{ for } i \neq j
\end{align}


-   Recall the $p$-value = `r round(0.04022, 4)`
-   Use $\alpha$ = 0.05
-   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?

__Conclusion statement__:

* There is sufficient evidence that at least one of the genotype groups has a change in arm strength statistically different from the other groups. ( $p$-value =`r round(0.04022, 4)`)

## Final note

::: columns
::: column
- Recall, visually the three looked pretty close

- This is the case that I would also do some work to report the means and standard deviations of each genotype's percent change in non-dominant arm strength. 
:::
::: column
```{r}
famuss %>% 
  group_by(actn3.r577x) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            mean = mean(ndrm.ch),
            SD = sd(ndrm.ch))
```
:::
:::

__Revised conclusion statement__:

* For people with CC genotype then mean percent change in arm non-dominant arm strength was 48.9% (SD = 30%). For CT, mean percent change was 53.2% (SD = 33.2%). For TT, mean percent change was 58.1% (SD = 35.7%). There is sufficient evidence that at least one of the genotype groups has a change in arm strength statistically different from the other groups. ( $p$-value =`r round(0.04022, 4)`)
