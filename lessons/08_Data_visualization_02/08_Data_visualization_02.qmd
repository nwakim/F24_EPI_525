## Where are we?

![](../img_slides/course_map.png){fig-align="center"}

## Relationships between two variables

- Many studies are motivated by a researcher examining how two or more variables are related

 

- Example questions about relationships:

  - Do the values of one variable increase as the values of another decrease? 
  - Do the values of one variable tend to differ by the levels of another variable?

 

- Today we are introducing **summarization and data visualization methods** for exploring and summarizing **relationships between two variables**

 

- Approaches vary depending on whether the two variables are:
  - Both numerical
  - Both categorical
  - One numerical and one categorical
  
## We often identify a response variable from our research question
  
::: columns
::: column

::: red
::: red-ttl
Response Variable
:::
::: red-cont
A **response variable** is defined by the particular research question a study seeks to address

- It **measures the outcome of interest** in the study
:::
:::
:::

::: column

::: blue
::: blue-ttl
Explanatory Variable
:::
::: blue-cont
A study will typically examine whether the values of a response variable differ as values of an **explanatory variable** change, and if so, how the two variables are related.

- A given study may examine several explanatory variables for a single response variable
:::
:::
:::
:::

- Sometimes we're interested in viewing the relationship between our **response variable** and **explanatory variable(s)**

- Sometimes we're just interested in viewing the relationship **between explanatory variables**

2.  Visualize relationships between two categorical variables using contingency tables and segmented barplots

3.  Visualize relationships between a categorical variable and a numeric variable using side-by-side boxplots, density plots, and ridgeline plots

## Scatterplots

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}

- Scatterplots provide case-by-case view of the **relationship between two numerical variables**

 

- We can make a scatterplot of clutch volume vs. body size, with clutch volume on the y-axis and body size on the x-axis
- Each point represents an observation (egg clutch) with its measurement for clutch volumn and body size of parent

```{r}
#| label: "scatter"
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
ggplot(data = frog, 
       aes(x = body.size,
           y = clutch.volume)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) +       
  labs(x = "Female Body Size (cm)",
       y = "Clutch Volume (mm3)") 
```

## Describing associations between 2 numerical variables

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Two variables $x$ and $y$ are 

  - [**Positively associated**]{style="color:#E75B5C;"} if $y$ increases as $x$ increases

  - [**Negatively associated**]{style="color:#BF396F;"} if $y$ decreases as $x$ increases
  
 

- If there is no association between the variables, then we say they are **uncorrelated** or **independent**

 

- The term "association" is a very general term

  - Can be used for numerical or categorical variables
  - Not specifically referring to linear associations

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| label: "scatter_out"
#| ref.label: "scatter"
#| echo: false
#| fig.keep: "first"
#| fig.height: 6
#| fig.width: 8
#| fig-align: center
```

::: lob
Female body size and clutch volume are positively associated with each other

## (Pearson) Correlation coefficient ($r$)

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
* $r = -1$ indicates a __perfect negative linear relationship__: As one variable increases, the value of the other variable tends to go down, following a *straight line*
* $r = 0$ indicates __no linear relationship__: The values of both variables go up/down independently of each other
* $r = 1$ indicates a __perfect positive linear relationship__: As the value of one variable goes up, the value of the other variable tends to go up as well in a linear fashion

 

* The closer $r$ is to ±1, the stronger the linear association
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

## Poll Everywhere Question 2



## (Pearson) Correlation coefficient ($r$): formula

The (Pearson) correlation coefficient of variables $x$ and $y$ can be computed using the formula
$$r = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\Big(\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s_x}\Big)\Big(\frac{y_i - \bar{y}}{s_y}\Big)$$
where 

* $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),...,(x_n,y_n)$ are the $n$ paired values of the variables $x$ and $y$ 
* $s_x$ and $s_y$ are the sample standard deviations of the variables $x$ and $y$, respectively

 

- We can use `cor()` in R to calculate this!
```{r}
cor(frog$body.size, frog$clutch.volume, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```

## From Lesson 4: Contingency tables

-   We can start looking at the **contingency table** for hypertension for different age groups
    -   **Contingency table:** type of data table that displays the frequency distribution of two or more categorical variables

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Create the table data
hyp_cont <- data.frame(
  Age_Group = c("18-39 years", "40-59 years", "60+ years", "Total"),
  Hypertension = c(8836, 42109, 39917, 90862),
  No_Hypertension = c(112206, 88663, 21589, 222458),
  Total = c(121042, 130772, 61506, 313320)
)

# Generate table using kable
kable(hyp_cont, col.names = c("Age Group", "Hypertension", "No Hypertension", "Total"), 
      caption = "Table: Contingency table showing hypertension status and age group, in
thousands.")
```

## From Lesson 4: Probability tables

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Create the table data
hyp_prob <- data.frame(
  Age_Group = c("18-39 years", "40-59 years", "60+ years", "Total"),
  Hypertension = c(0.0282, 0.1344, 0.1274, 0.2900),
  No_Hypertension = c(0.3581, 0.2830, 0.0689, 0.7100),
  Total = c(0.3863, 0.4174, 0.1963, 1)
)

# Generate table using kable
kable(hyp_prob, col.names = c("Age Group", "Hypertension", "No Hypertension", "Total"), 
      caption = "Table: Probability table summarizing hypertension status and age group.")
```

- [**Joint probability**]{style="color:#E75B5C;"}: intersection of row and column
    
- [**Marginal probability**]{style="color:#BF396F;"}: row or column total

 

::: lob
We can work towards visualizing the data in contingency and probability tables
:::

## Last time: Barplots
Counts (below) vs. percentages (right)

::: columns

::: column
```{r}
ggplot(data = hyp_data, 
       aes(x = Age_Group)) + 
  geom_bar()
```
:::

::: column
```{r}
ggplot(data = hyp_data, 
       aes(x = Age_Group)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = stat(prop), 
               group = 1))
```
:::

## Barplots with 2 variables: segmented bar plots

- Way of visualizing the information from a contingency table

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
ggplot(data = hyp_data, 
       aes(x = Age_Group, 
       fill = Hypertension)) + 
  geom_bar() 
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3-4"
ggplot(data = hyp_data, 
       aes(x = Age_Group, 
       fill = Hypertension)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill")  
```
:::

## Poll Everywhere Question 3



## Barplots with 2 variables: side-by-side bar plots

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3-4"
ggplot(data = hyp_data, 
       aes(x = Age_Group, 
       fill = Hypertension)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") 
```

# Learning Objectives

1.  Visualize relationships between two numeric variables using scatterplots and determine their correlation

2.  Visualize relationships between two categorical variables using contingency tables and segmented barplots

::: lob
3.  Visualize relationships between a categorical variable and a numeric variable using side-by-side boxplots, density plots, and ridgeline plots
:::

## Visualizing relationships between numerical and categorical variables

::: {.column width="55%"}
- Useful visualizations for directly comparing how the [**distribution of a numerical variable**]{style="color:#EF85B3;"} [**differs by category**]{style="color:#367B79;"}:
  
   
  
  - Side-by-side boxplots
  
   
  
  - Side-by-side boxplots with data points
  
   
  
  - Density plots by group
  
   
  
  - Ridgeline plot
:::

## We need to introduce a new dataset for this

- Study investigating whether ACTN3 genotype at a particular location (residue 577) is associated with change in muscle function

 

- **Categorical variable:** genotypes (CC, TT, CT)

 

- **Numeric variable:** Muscle function, measured as percent change in non-dominant arm strength

 

- We can start the investigation by plotting the relationship

## Side-by-side boxplots 

- We can look at the boxplot of percent change for each genotype

::: columns
::: {.column width="53%"}
```{r}
#| label: "box_sbs"
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "2-4"
ggplot(data = famuss, 
       aes(x = actn3.r577x, 
           y = ndrm.ch)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "ACTN3 genotype", 
       y = "Percent Change in Non-Dominant Arm Strength")  
```
:::

::: {.column width="47%"}
```{r}
#| label: "box_sbs_out"
#| ref.label: "box_sbs"
#| echo: false
#| fig.keep: "first"
#| fig.height: 7.5
#| fig.width: 7
```
:::
:::

## Side-by-side boxplots with data points

- We can look at the boxplot of percent change for each genotype **with points shown so we can see the distribution of observations better**

::: columns
::: {.column width="53%"}
```{r}
#| label: "box_sbs_jitter"
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "7-11"
ggplot(data = famuss, 
       aes(x = actn3.r577x, 
           y = ndrm.ch)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "ACTN3 genotype", 
       y = "Percent Change in Non-Dominant Arm Strength")  +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = actn3.r577x), 
    alpha = 0.3,      
    show.legend = FALSE,      
    position = position_jitter(     
      height = 0.4))      
```

:::
::: {.column width="47%"}
```{r}
#| label: "box_sbs_jitter_out"
#| ref.label: "box_sbs_jitter"
#| echo: false
#| fig.keep: "first"
#| fig.height: 7.5
#| fig.width: 7
```
:::
:::

## Density plots by group

- Allows us to see the densities of percent change for each genotype

```{r}
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.width: 12
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
#| fig-align: center
ggplot(data = famuss, aes(color = actn3.r577x, x = ndrm.ch)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  labs(x = "Percent Change in Non-Dominant Arm Strength", color = "ACTN3 genotype")  
```


## Ridgeline plot 

- Overlapped densities were easy enough to see with 3 genotypes
- If you have **many categories**, a ridgeline plot might make it easier to see

::: columns
::: {.column width="53%"}
```{r}
#| label: "density_ridge"
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "6-7"
library(ggridges)
ggplot(data = famuss, 
       aes(y = actn3.r577x, 
           x = ndrm.ch, 
           fill = actn3.r577x)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.3, 
          show.legend = FALSE) +      
  labs(x = "Percent Change in Non-Dominant Arm Strength",
       y = "ACTN3 genotype",
       title = "Strength change by genotype")       
```
:::
::: {.column width="47%"}
```{r}
#| label: "density_ridge_out"
#| ref.label: "density_ridge"
#| echo: false
#| fig.keep: "first"
#| fig.height: 7.5
#| fig.width: 7.5
