## Load packages

* Packages need to be loaded _every time_ you restart R or render an Qmd file

```{r}
# run these every time you open Rstudio
library(tidyverse)    
library(oibiostat)
library(janitor)
library(rstatix)
library(knitr)
library(gtsummary)
library(moderndive)
library(gt)
library(broom) 
library(here) 
library(pwr) 
library(BSDA)  # NEW package!!!
```


- You can check whether a package has been loaded or not 
  - by looking at the Packages tab and 
  - seeing whether it has been checked off or not

# Nonparametric tests

## Background: parametric vs nonparametric

* Prior inference of means methods had conditions assuming the underlying population(s) was (were) normal (or at least approximately normal).
* Normal distribution is completely described (parameterized) by two parameters: $\mu$ and $\sigma$. 
* The first was often the parameter of interest, while the latter was assumed known ( $Z$-test) or estimated ( $t$-tests).
* The above are therefore described as __parametric__ procedures.

* __Nonparametric__ procedures 
    * Make fewer assumptions about the structure of the underlying  population from which the samples were collected.
    * Work well when distributional assumptions are in doubt.
   


## The good and the bad about nonparametric tests

__Good__  

* Fewer assumptions 
* Tests are based on ranks
    * Therefore outliers have no greater influence than non-outliers.
    * Since tests are based on ranks we can apply these procedures to
ordinal data 
        * (where means and standard deviations are not meaningful).

__Drawbacks__

* Less powerful than parametric tests (due to loss of information when data are converted to ranks)
* While the test is easy, it may require substantial (computer) work to develop a confidence interval [by "inverting" the test].
* Theory was developed for continuous data (where ties are not possible); if population or data contain many ties, then a correction to the procedures must be implemented.
* Some procedures have "large" and "small" sample versions; the small sample versions require special tables or a computer.



# Sign test

For paired data or single samples



## Example: Intraocular pressure of glaucoma patients


* Intraocular pressure of glaucoma patients is often reduced by treatment with adrenaline. 
* A __new synthetic drug__ is being considered, but it is more expensive than the __current adrenaline alternative__. 
* 7 glaucoma patients were treated with both drugs: 
    * one eye with adrenaline and 
    * the other with the synthetic drug
* __Reduction in pressure__ was recorded in each eye after following treatment (larger numbers indicate greater reduction)




```{r}
IOP_table <- tibble(
  Patient = 1:7,
  Adren = c(3.5, 2.6, 3, 1.9, 2.9, 2.4, 2),
  Synth = c(3.2, 3.1, 3.3, 2.4, 2.9, 2.8, 2.6)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    d = Synth - Adren,
    Sign = case_when(
      d < 0 ~ "-",
      d > 0 ~ "+"
      )
    )
IOP_table %>% gt()

```

* __d__ is the difference in reduction of pressure: __Synth - Adren__
* __Sign__ is `+` if the difference is positive and `-` if the difference is negative




### Visualize the differences

Visualize the differences in reduction of pressure $d$ : __Synth - Adren__



```{r}
ggplot(IOP_table, aes(x = d)) +
  geom_dotplot()
```



```{r}
ggplot(IOP_table, aes(x = d)) +
  geom_density()
```





## Hypotheses & "statistic" (Sign test)


__Hypotheses__

$H_0:$ The median difference in the population is 0  
$H_a:$ The median difference in the population is NOT 0

<hr>

__"Statistic"__  

$D^+$ = number of positive differences  
$D^-$ = number of negative differences

<hr>

What are $D^+$ and $D^-$ for our example?



```{r}
IOP_table %>% gt()
```





## Exact p-value (Sign test)

* If the median difference is 0 ( $H_0$ is true) , then 
      * half the population consists of positive differences 
      * while half have negative differences.

* Let $p=P(\textrm{neg. diff.})=P(\textrm{pos. diff.})= 0.5$

<hr>

* If the median difference is 0 ( $H_0$ is true), 
      * then a sample of $n$ differences 
          * behaves like $n$ trials in a binomial experiment 
          * where "success" is analogous to seeing a positive difference.
      * By symmetry ( $p=0.5$ ), the same distribution applies to negative differences, i.e.,

$$D^+ \textrm{ and } D^- \sim \textrm{Bin}(n,p=0.5)$$ 
<hr>

* Thus the (exact) p-value is calculated using the Binomial distribution




## Glaucoma example (exact) p-value


* 7 differences: 
  * 1 negative ( $D^-$ )
  * 5 were positive ( $D^+$ )
  * 1 difference is 0 and is discarded
* Thus the effective sample size is $n=6$.

<hr>
__One-sided p-value__ = probability that we would see 1 or fewer negative signs among the $n=6$ differences, if the median difference is really 0

<hr>

__Two-sided p-value__ = 2 $\times$ One-sided p-value

```{r}
# 2-sided p-value: 2*P(D^- <= 1)
2*pbinom(1, size = 6, p = 0.5)
```



$$D^- \sim \textrm{Bin}(n=6,p=0.5)$$ 

<br>

<hr>

$$p-value = P(D^- \leq 1) \\
= P(D^-=0) + P(D^-=1) \\
= \frac{6!}{0!6!} (0.5)^6 + \frac{6!}{1!5!} (0.5)^6 \\
\approx 0.1094$$

<hr>

$$p-value \times 2 \approx 0.2188$$



## Sign test in R: Glaucoma example

Below we create the dataset as a tibble (and add the signs):

```{r}
IOP <- tibble(
  Patient = 1:7,
  Adren = c(3.5, 2.6, 3, 1.9, 2.9, 2.4, 2),
  Synth = c(3.2, 3.1, 3.3, 2.4, 2.9, 2.8, 2.6)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(d = Synth - Adren,
    Sign = case_when(
      d < 0 ~ "-",
      d > 0 ~ "+"))

IOP %>% gt()
```

Recall we're testing the population median.  
Here's the sample median:
```{r}
median(IOP$d)
```



## Sign test in R: Glaucoma example (specifying both columns)

```{r}
library(BSDA)  # new package!! Make sure to first install it
# Can't "tidy" the output
SIGN.test(x = IOP$Synth, y = IOP$Adren, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```




### Sign test in R: Glaucoma example (specifying differences)

```{r}
# Note output calls this a "One-sample Sign-Test"
SIGN.test(x = IOP$d, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```




## Conclusion


Recall the hypotheses to the sign test:

$H_0:$ The median population difference in reduction of intraocular pressure in treatment with adrenaline vs. new synthetic drug is 0.

$H_a:$ The median population difference in reduction of intraocular pressure in treatment with adrenaline vs. new synthetic drug is NOT 0.

* Significance level: $\alpha$ = 0.05
* p-value = 0.2188


__Conclusion__:

The median difference in reduction of intraocular pressure between eyes being treated with the synthetic drug and adrenaline for seven glaucoma patients was 0.4 (95% CI: -0.2, 0.6).  
There is insufficient evidence the reduction in intraocular pressure differs when using the synthetic drug and adrenaline (2-sided sign test $p$-value = 0.219). 



## Sign test with large samples: p-value normal approximation

* If the sample size is large, say greater than 20, 
    * then binomial probabilities can be approximated using normal probabilities

* Normal approximation: 

$$\mu = np =n(0.5)=n/2\\
\sigma=\sqrt{np(1-p)}=\sqrt{n(0.5)(0.5)}= \sqrt{n}/2$$

* Thus we have the test statistic:

$$z=\frac{D^- −n/2}{\sqrt{n}/2}$$

* With access to a computer, it's better to use the exact binomial probabilities instead of the normal approximation.



## Sign test with one sample

* One can use the sign test when testing just one sample.
* Note that we did this when in R, when running the sign test using just the differences.
* For one sample, we can specify the null population median value:

$H_0:$ The population median is $m$  
$H_a:$ The population median is NOT $m$

Example: Run sign test for paired data with null $m = 0.7$: 

```{r}
SIGN.test(x = IOP$d, md = 0.7, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```




# (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test

For paired data or single samples;  
accounts for sizes of differences


## (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test

* Like the sign test, the (Wilcoxon) signed-rank test is used for
    * paired samples (i.e., a single set of differences) or 
    * a one-sample comparison against a specified value

* However, this test _does_ make use of information concerning the size
 of the differences.
 
<hr>
 
 __Hypotheses__

$H_0:$ the population is __symmetric around some value__ $\tilde{\mu}_0$  
$H_a:$ the population is __not symmetric around some value__ $\tilde{\mu}_0$

* Even if the population has a mean/median equal to $\tilde{\mu}_0$, the
 test may reject the null if the population isn't symmetric, thus only use if the data (differences) are symmetric. 
* If the population is symmetric 
    * then the mean and median coincide, 
    * thus often the null hypothesis is phrased in terms of the median difference being 0
 



## Example: calculate signed ranks

* Rank the absolute values of the differences from smallest to largest
* For ties, take the average of the highest and lowest tied ranks
    * I.e. if ranks 3-7 are tied, then assign (3+7)/2 = 5 as the rank
* Then calculate the signed ranks as +/- the rank depending on whether the sign is +/-

```{r}
IOP_ranks <- IOP %>% 
  mutate(
    Rank = c(1.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, NA, 3, 6),
    Signed_rank = case_when(
      d < 0 ~ -Rank,
      d > 0 ~ Rank
      )
    )
IOP_ranks %>% gt()
```


### New: Calculate ranks using R's `rank()` function

* Below I create the ranks using R's `rank()` function that has an option `ties.method` to specify how to calculate ties. 
* This doesn't require first sorting the data. 
* However, it includes a difference of 0 in the ranking, and thus below I first remove the row with $d=0$ from the data.
* In the output below, I called this column `Rank_R`.

```{r}
IOP_Ranks_R <- IOP_ranks %>% 
  filter(d != 0) %>% 
  mutate(
    # create column with absolute values of differences
    # it's the absolute values that get ranked
    abs_d = abs(d), 
    # create column with ranks that accounts for ties using R's rank() function
    # you don't need to first sort the data to use this command
    Rank_R = rank(abs_d, ties.method = "average"),
    Signed_Rank_R = case_when(
      d < 0 ~ -Rank_R,
      d > 0 ~ Rank_R
      )
    ) 

IOP_Ranks_R %>% gt()

```



## Test statistic (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test

__If the null is true:__

* The population is symmetric around some point ( $\tilde{\mu}_0 = 0$ ,
  typically), and 

* The __overall size of the positive ranks should be about the same
  as the overall size of negative ranks__.

Note: 

* The sum of the ranks $1,2,\dotsc, n$ is always $n(n+1)/2$,
* which can be broken down as the 
    * sum of the positive ranks ( $T^+$ )
    * plus the sum of the negative ranks ( $T^-$ )

Thus, any of the following can be used as a test statistic and will lead to the same conclusion:
     
* $T^+$
* $T^-$
* $T^+$ - $T^-$
* $\min(T^+,T^−) = T_0$



## Example: calculate sums of signed ranks

```{r}
IOP_ranks %>% gt()
```

* Sum of the positive ranks 
    * $T^+$ = 1.5 + 3 + 4.5 + 4.5 + 6 = 19.5

* Sum of the negative ranks
    * $T^-$ = -1.5

* The sum of the ranks $1,2,\dotsc, n$ is always $n(n+1)/2$:
    * $n(n+1)/2 = 6(7)/2 = 21$
    * $T^+ + |T^-| = 19.5 + |-1.5| = 21$



## Exact p-value (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test (fyi) (1/2)

* __Exact p-value__ is preferable
    * This is the default method in R's `wilcox.test()`
        * if the samples contain less than 50 finite values 
        * and __there are no ties__
          * _R will automatically use normal approximation method if there are ties_

* _We will not be calculating the exact p-value "by hand." We will be using R for this._

<hr>

<br>

$$p-value = 2 * P(\min(T^+,T^−) \leq t)$$

* $t$ is the smaller of the calculated sums of the positive and negative ranks
* To calculate the exact p-value, we need the probability of each possible sum of ranks.

### Exact p-value (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test (fyi) (2/2)


* To calculate the exact p-value, we need the probability of each possible sum of ranks:
    * list all possible combinations of positive and negative ranks for the sample size,
    * calculate the sum of the positive ranks ( $T^+$ ) for each possible combination (or $T^-$ ), and
    * then figure out the probability of each possible $T^+$ (assuming all combinations are equally likely)

See https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat415/lesson/20/20.2 for more details.



## Normal approximation p-value (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test (fyi)

* __Normal approximation__ method:
    * If the number of non-zero differences is at least 16, then a normal approximation can be used.
    * Have the option to apply a continuity correct (default) or not 
* _We will not be calculating the p-value "by hand." We will be using R for this._

<hr>

Test statistic:

$$Z_{T_{min}} = \frac{T_{min} - \frac{n(n+1)}{4}}{\sqrt{\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{24}}}$$

* $T_{min} = \min(T^+,T^−)$
* $n$ = sample size
* Test statistic $Z_{T_{min}}$ follows a standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$
* Use normal distribution to calculate p-value


See https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat415/lesson/20/20.2 for more details.



## (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test in R: Glaucoma example

"Attempt" with exact p-value & specifying columns for paired data 

```{r}
#| warning: true
# Exact p-value
wilcox.test(x = IOP$Synth, y = IOP$Adren, paired = TRUE, 
	alternative = c("two.sided"), mu = 0, 
	exact = TRUE)
```

"Attempt" with exact p-value & running one sample test with differences

```{r}
#| warning: true
# Exact p-value
wilcox.test(x = IOP$d, 
		alternative = c("two.sided"), mu = 0, 
		exact = TRUE, correct = TRUE)
```



## (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test in R: Glaucoma example

"Attempt" with approximate p-value & specifying columns for paired data 

```{r}
#| warning: true
# Normal approximation with continuity correction
wilcox.test(x = IOP$Synth, y = IOP$Adren, paired = TRUE, 
		alternative = c("two.sided"), mu = 0, 
		exact = FALSE, correct = TRUE)
```

No more warnings!! However,... should we be using the normal approximation here?



## Conclusion

Recall the hypotheses to the (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test:

$H_0:$ the population difference in reduction of intraocular pressure in treatment with adrenaline vs. new synthetic drug is __symmetric around__ $\tilde{\mu}_0 =0$  
$H_a:$ the population difference in reduction of intraocular pressure in treatment with adrenaline vs. new synthetic drug is __not symmetric around__ $\tilde{\mu}_0 =0$

* Significance level: $\alpha$ = 0.05
* p-value = 0.07314


__Conclusion__:

There is insufficient evidence the differences in reduction in intraocular pressure differs between the synthetic drug and adrenaline are symmetric about 0 (2-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test $p$-value = 0.07314)

However,... 




# Wilcoxon rank-sum test

For two independent samples  
a.k.a Mann-Whitney U test


## Wilcoxon rank-sum test

* The nonparametric alternative to the two-sample $t$-test
    * used to analyze two samples selected from separate (independent)
populations
* Also called the Mann-Whitney U test.
* Unlike the signed-rank test, there is no need to assume symmetry

* Necessary __condition__ is that the two populations being compared 
    * have the same shape (both right skewed, both left skewed, or both symmetric), 
    * so any noted difference is due to a shift in the median

* Since they have the same shape, when summarizing the test, we can describe the results in terms of a difference in medians.  


__Hypotheses__:

$H_0:$ the two populations have the same median  
$H_a:$ the two populations do NOT have the same median



## Example

Dr. Priya Chaudhary (OHSU) examined the evoked membrane current of dental sensory neurons (in rats) under control conditions and a mixture of capsaicin plus capsazepine (CPZ). [J. Dental Research} 80:1518--23, 2001.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00220345010800060801)


```{r}
CPZdata <- tibble(
  control = c(3024, 2164, 864, 780, 125, 110),
  cap_CPZ = c(426, 232, 130, 94, 75, 55)
  ) 

CPZdata %>% gt()

CPZdata %>% get_summary_stats(type = "median") %>% gt()
```



## Visualize the data

__Do the independent samples have the same distribution?__

Control group

```{r}
ggplot(CPZdata, aes(x = control)) +
  geom_dotplot()

ggplot(CPZdata, aes(x = control)) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(CPZdata, aes(x = control)) +
  geom_density()
```

Cap + CPZ group

```{r}
ggplot(CPZdata, aes(x = cap_CPZ)) +
  geom_dotplot()

ggplot(CPZdata, aes(x = cap_CPZ)) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(CPZdata, aes(x = cap_CPZ)) +
  geom_density()
```



## Calculating ranks and test statistic $W$

1. Combine the two samples together (keep track of which observations came from each sample).

2. Rank the full set of $N=n_1 + n_2$ observations. 
    * If ties exist, assign average ranks to the tied values (as with the signed-rank test).

3. Sum the ranks corresponding to those observations from the smaller
sample. 
    * This is a time-saving step; you could also have used the larger sample.
    * Call this sum $W$.

4. If $n_1, n_2$ are both less than 10, then use an exact test (can only be done if no ties are present)
    * otherwise use the  large-sample normal approximation.

In our example, both groups have equal n; choose either for computing W.

$$W_{CPZ}=1+2+3+6+7+8 = 27$$

$$W_{control}=4+5+9+10+11+12 = 51$$

```{r}
CPZdata_long <- CPZdata %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(control,cap_CPZ), 
               names_to = "Group",
               values_to = "Current") %>% 
  arrange(Current) %>% 
  mutate(Rank = 1:12)

CPZdata_long %>% gt()
```


### New: calculate ranks's using `rank()`

* Below I create the ranks using R's `rank()` function that has an option `ties.method` to specify how to calculate ties. 
* This doesn't require first sorting the data. 
* In the output below, I called this column `Rank_R`.

```{r}
CPZdata_long <- CPZdata_long %>% 
  mutate(
    # create column with ranks that accounts for ties using R's rank() function
    # you don't need to first sort the data to use this command
    Rank_R = rank(Current, ties.method = "average")
    ) 

CPZdata_long %>% gt()

```    
 
 
## Exact p-value approach

* __If $n_1, n_2$ are both less than 10, then use an exact test__, 
    * otherwise use the large-sample normal approximation.
    * However, exact method can only be done if __no ties__ are present

* p-value is the probability of getting a rank sum $W$ as extreme or more extreme than the observed one.
    * Multiply the 1-tail probability by 2 for the 2-tailed probability

$$p-value = 2 \cdot P(W_{CPZ} \leq 27)$$

* To calculate $P(W_{CPZ} \leq 27)$, 
    * we need to enumerate all possible sets ranks for the sample size,  
    * calculate the sum of ranks for each set of possible ranks,
    * and then the probability for each sum (assuming each set of ranks is equally likely).

<hr>

* _We will not be calculating the p-value "by hand." We will be using R for this._



## Normal approximation approach

If the null hypothesis is true, then the mean of the sum of the ranks from the smaller-sized group will be

$$\mu_W = \dfrac{n_s \cdot (n_s + n_l + 1)}{2},$$
with a standard deviation of

$$\sigma_W = \sqrt{ \dfrac{n_s\cdot n_l \cdot (n_s + n_l + 1)}{12} }.$$
Provided both groups are large ( $\geq 10$ ),

$$Z = \frac{W - \mu_W}{\sigma_W}  \approx Normal(0,1)$$



### Example:

We have $W=27$ and $n_l = n_s = 6$:

$$\mu_W = \dfrac{6 \cdot (6 + 6 +1 )}{2} = 39 \\
\sigma_W  = \sqrt{\dfrac{6\cdot 6 \cdot (6+6+1)}{12}} = \sqrt{39} \approx 6.2450 \\
z \approx \frac{27-39}{6.2450} = -1.921538$$


The two-sided $p$-value is 
$$p=2 \cdot P(Z < -1.921538)=0.05466394$$ 

    
```{r}
2 * pnorm((27-39) / sqrt(39))
```

## Conclusion



Recall the hypotheses to the (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test:

$H_0:$ the control and treated populations have the same median  
$H_a:$ the control and treated populations do NOT have the same median

* Significance level: $\alpha$ = 0.05
* p-value = 0.06494


__Conclusion__:

There is suggestive but inconclusive evidence that the evoked membrane current of dental sensory neurons (in rats) differs between the control group and the group exposed to a mixture of capsaicin plus capsazepine (2-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test $p$-value = 0.06494).



# Kruskal-Wallis test

Nonparametric ANOVA test


## Kruskal-Wallis test: nonparametric ANOVA test

* Recall that an ANOVA tests means from more than 2 groups
* Conditions for ANOVA include
    * Sample sizes in each group group are large (each $n \ge 30$),  
        * OR the data are relatively normally distributed in each group
    * Variability is "similar" in all group groups

* If these conditions are in doubt, or if the response is ordinal, then the Kruskal-Wallis test is an alternative.

\begin{align}
H_0 &: \text{pop median}_1 = \text{pop median}_2 = ... = \text{pop median}_k\\
\text{vs. } H_A&: \text{At least one pair } \text{pop median}_i \neq \text{pop median}_j \text{ for } i \neq j
\end{align}

* K-W test is an extension of the (Wilcoxon) rank-sum test to more than 2 groups
    * With $k=2$ groups, the K-W test is the same as the rank-sum test



## K-W test statistic: $H$ (fyi)

$$H = \frac{12}{{N(N + 1)}} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{R_i^2}{n_i} - 3(N + 1)$$

* $k$ is the number of groups,
* $n_i$ is the number of observations in group  $i$
* $N = n_1 + \ldots + n_k$ is the total number of observations across all groups,
* $R_i$ is the sum of ranks for group $i$

The test statistic $H$ has a Chi-squared distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom:

$$H \sim \chi^2_{k-1}$$

Ranks are calculated similarly to the (Wilcoxon) rank-sum test.



## Ranks for the K-W test

1. Combine the $k$ samples together (keep track of which observations came from each sample).
2. Rank the full set of $N = n_1 + \ldots + n_k$ observations. 
    * If ties exist, assign average ranks to the tied values (as with the signed-rank test).
3. Then sum the ranks within each of the $k$ groups
    * Label the sums of the ranks for each group as $R_1, \ldots + R_k$.

If $H_0$ is true, we expect the populations to have the same medians, and thus the ranks to be similar as well.



## Example: Ozone levels by month 

* `airquality` data included in base R - no need to load it
* Daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973.
* Question: do ozone levels differ by month?

```{r}
glimpse(airquality)
```


```{r}
Oz_mnth <- airquality %>% 
  group_by(Month) %>% 
  get_summary_stats(Ozone, 
    show = c("n", "mean", "median", "sd"))
Oz_mnth %>% gt()

max(Oz_mnth$sd) / min(Oz_mnth$sd)
```


```{r}
#| fig.height: 5.0
ggplot(airquality,
       aes(x = Ozone, y = factor(Month))) +
  geom_boxplot()
```



## Example: calculate ranks (fyi) 

```{r}
ranks_Oz_mnth <- airquality %>% 
  select(Ozone, Month) 

summary(ranks_Oz_mnth)

ranks_Oz_mnth <- ranks_Oz_mnth %>% 
  drop_na(Ozone) %>% 
  arrange(Ozone) %>% 
  mutate(Rank = 1:nrow(.))
```

Ranks below do not take into account ties!!

```{r}
head(ranks_Oz_mnth, 20)
```


Sum of ranks for each group: (not taking into account ties!!)

```{r}
ranks_Oz_mnth %>% 
  group_by(Month) %>% 
  summarise(sumRank = sum(Rank))
```



### New: calculate ranks's using `rank()`

* Below I create the ranks using R's `rank()` function that has an option `ties.method` to specify how to calculate ties. 
* This doesn't require first sorting the data. 
* In the output below, I called this column `Rank_R`.

```{r}
ranks_Oz_mnth <- ranks_Oz_mnth %>% 
  mutate(
    # create column with ranks that accounts for ties using R's rank() function
    # you don't need to first sort the data to use this command
    Rank_R = rank(Ozone, ties.method = "average")
    ) 

# Compare "simple" ranks not including ties with tie-corrected ranks
head(ranks_Oz_mnth, 20)

``` 


## K-W test in R

```{r}
kruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)

kruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality) %>% tidy() %>% gt()
```

There is sufficient evidence that the median ozone levels are different in at least two months from May - September, 1973 in New York City (p < 0.001; Kruskal-Wallis test).


* (fyi) Since the K-W test is significant, follow-up with pairwise (Wilcoxon) rank-sum tests using a multiple comparison procedure to identify which months have different medians.




# Permutation tests & bootstrapping

another option to consider



## Permutation tests & bootstrapping

* In some cases we saw that the conditions failed or the sample size was too small for a normal approximation and there were ties in ranks preventing us from using an exact method.

* Another nonparametric option to consider is a permutation test or bootstrapping.
