## Intro to Data

![[Artwork by \@allison_horst](https://allisonhorst.com/r-packages-functions)](../img_slides/horst_data_cowboy.png){fig-align="center"}

## Example: the frog study[^1]

[^1]: From *Introductory Statistics for the Life and Biomedical Sciences*

In evolutionary biology, parental investment refers to the amount of time, energy, or other resources devoted towards raising offspring.

 

We will be working with the `frog` dataset, which originates from a 2013 study[^2] about maternal investment in a frog species. Reproduction is a costly process for female frogs, necessitating a trade-off between individual egg size and total number of eggs produced.

[^2]: Chen, W., et al. Maternal investment increases with altitude in a frog on the Tibetan Plateau. Journal of evolutionary biology 26.12 (2013): 2710-2715.

    ## 

 

Researchers were interested in investigating how maternal investment varies with altitude. They collected measurements on egg clutches found at breeding ponds across 11 study sites; for 5 sites, the body size of individual female frogs was also recorded.

-   Each **row** is an [**observation**]{style="color:#BF396F;"}
-   Each **column** is a [**variable**]{style="color:#459B99;"}
-   All the [**observations**]{style="color:#BF396F;"} and [**variables**]{style="color:#459B99;"} together make a [**data frame**]{style="color:#8043F3;"} (sometimes called data matrix)

 

-   **Missing values:** `NA` means the measured value for body size in clutch #150 is missing

## Frog study: variables and their descriptions

-   [**Variables**]{style="color:#459B99;"} are recorded characteristics for each [**observation**]{style="color:#BF396F;"}

| **Variable**    | **Description**                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `altitude`      | Altitude of the study site in meters above sea level |
| `latitude`      | Latitude of the study site measured in degrees       |
| `egg.size`      | Average diameter of an individual egg to the 0.01 mm |
| `clutch.size`   | Estimated number of eggs in clutch                   |
| `clutch.volume` | Volume of egg clutch in mm³                          |

## Types of variables (1/2)

::: columns
::: column
::: orange
::: orange-ttl
Numerical variables
:::

::: orange-cont
**Numerical variables** take on numerical values, such that numerical operations (sums, differences, etc.) are reasonable.

-   Discrete: only take on integer values (e.g., \# of family members)

-   Continuous: can take on any value within a specified range (e.g., height)
:::
:::
:::

::: column
::: pink
::: pink-ttl
Categorical variables
:::

::: pink-cont
**Categorical variables** take on values that are names or labels; the possible values are called the variable's *levels*.

-   Ordinal: exists some natural ordering of levels (e.g., level of education)
-   Nominal: no natural ordering of levels (e.g., gender identity)

## Poll Everywhere Question 2

## Poll Everywhere Question 3

## Variable (column) types in `R`

-   We have not done much with `R` yet, but I want this to serve as a reference for you!
-   Variable types (as we speak them) are translated by `R` a little differently
-   Below is the mapping of `R` types to variable types

| R type            | variable type | description                                       |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| integer           | discrete      | integer-valued numbers                            |
| double or numeric | continuous    | numbers that are decimals                         |
| factor            | categorical   | categorical variables stored with levels (groups) |
| character         | categorical   | text, "strings"                                   |
| logical           | categorical   | boolean (TRUE, FALSE)                             |

## Exploring data with simple tools

-   Techniques for exploring and summarizing data **differ** for [**numerical**]{style="color:#E75B5C;"} versus [**categorical**]{style="color:#EF85B3;"} variables.

 

-   Numerical and graphical summaries are useful for examining variables one at a time
    -   Can also be used for exploring the relationships between variables
    -   *Numerical* summaries are not just for [**numerical**]{style="color:#E75B5C;"} variables (certain ones are used for [**categorical**]{style="color:#EF85B3;"} variables)

 

-   Let's start looking into ways to summarize and explore [**numerical**]{style="color:#E75B5C;"} data!

    -   We will come back to [**categorical**]{style="color:#EF85B3;"} variables another day

# Learning Objectives

## 

::: blue
::: blue-ttl
Warning!
:::

::: blue-cont
I decided to keep some `R` code in these slides. It's going to be a little confusing now, but I thought it would be a worthwhile reference as soon as we get through R basics
:::
:::

## Measures of center: [mean]{style="color:#5BAFF8;"}

::: blue
::: blue-ttl
Sample mean
:::

::: blue-cont
the average value of observations

$$\overline{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{x_i}{n}$$

where $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ represent the $n$ observed values in a sample
:::
:::

**Example**: What is the mean clutch volume in the `frog` dataset?

$$\overline{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{431}\frac{x_i}{431}$$

```{r}
mean(frog$clutch.volume)
```

**Answer:** the mean clutch volume is `r round(mean(frog$clutch.volume), 1)` $\text{mm}^3$.

## Measures of center: [median]{style="color:#EF85B3;"}

::: pink
::: pink-ttl
Median
:::

::: pink-cont
-   The middle value of the observations in a sample

-   The median is the 50th percentile, meaning

    -   50% of observations lie below the median
    -   50% of observations lie above the median
:::
:::

-   If the number of observations is
    -   Odd: the median is the middle observed value
    -   Even: the median is the average of the two middle observed values
-   We can calculate the median clutch volume

```{r}
median(frog$clutch.volume)
```

## Measures of center: [mean]{style="color:#5BAFF8;"} vs. [median]{style="color:#EF85B3;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.width: 14

frog_long <- frog %>% pivot_longer(clutch.size:egg.size, names_to = "msr")

ggplot(frog_long %>% filter(msr != "body.size"), aes(x= value)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(msr), scales="free") +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Histograms of four variables in frog dataset")
```

-   Mean values will be pulled towards extreme values

# Learning Objectives

1.  Define observations and variables, and recognize them in a data frame.
2.  Define four variable types in data.
3.  Define and calculate measures of center (including mean and median).

::: lob
4.  Define and calculate measures of spread (including standard deviation and interquartile range).
:::

## Measures of spread: [standard deviation (SD)]{style="color:#E75B5C;"} (1/3)

::: orange
::: orange-ttl
Standard deviation (SD)
:::

::: orange-cont
(Approximately) the average distance between a typical observation and the mean

-   An observation's **deviation** is the distance between its value $x$ and the sample mean $\overline{x}$: deviation = $x - \overline{x}$
:::
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.width: 14

sim_diff_sd <- data.frame(
  id = 1:100,
  sd1 = rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 10),
  sd2 = rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 30),
  sd3 = rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 50)
)

sim_diff_sd_long <- sim_diff_sd %>%
  pivot_longer(sd1:sd3, names_to = "sd")

ggplot(sim_diff_sd_long, aes(x= value)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(sd)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Simulated data with different standard deviations")

```

## Measures of spread: [SD]{style="color:#E75B5C;"} (2/3)

-   The **sample variance** $s^2$ is the sum of squared deviations divided by the number of observations minus 1. $$s^2 = \frac{(x_1 - \overline{x})^2+(x_2 - \overline{x})^2+\cdots+(x_n - \overline{x})^2}{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1}$$ where $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ represent the $n$ observed values.

 

-   The [**standard deviation**]{style="color:#E75B5C;"} $s$ (or $sd$) is the square root of the variance. $$s = \sqrt{\frac{({x_1 - \overline{x})}^{2}+({x_2 - \overline{x})}^{2}+\cdots+({x_n - \overline{x})}^{2}}{n-1}} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1}}$$

## Measures of spread: [SD]{style="color:#E75B5C;"} (3/3)

Let's calculate the sample standard deviation for the clutch volume:

 

$s = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1}} =$

-   Doing this by hand would be really time consuming!
-   `R` can easily do this for us!

 

```{r}
mean(frog$clutch.volume)
sd(frog$clutch.volume)
```

 

**Answer:** The standard deviation of the clutch volume is 379.05 mm^3^

## Empirical Rule: one way to think about the SD

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
For symmetric bell-shaped data, about

-   68% of the data are within 1 SD of the mean
-   95% of the data are within 2 SD's of the mean
-   99.7% of the data are within 3 SD's of the mean

These percentages are based off of percentages of a true normal distribution.

:::

## Measures of spread: [interquartile range (IQR)]{style="color:#459B99;"} (1/2)

The $p^{th}$ percentile is the observation such that $p\%$ of the remaining observations fall below this observation.

-   The *first quartile* $Q_1$ is the $25^{th}$ percentile.
-   The *second quartile* $Q_2$, i.e., the median, is the $50^{th}$ percentile.
-   The *third quartile* $Q_3$ is the $75^{th}$ percentile.

::: green2
::: green2-ttl
Interquartile range (IQR)
:::

::: green2-cont
The distance between the third and first quartiles. $$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$

-   IQR is the width of the *middle half* of the data
:::
:::

## Measures of spread: [IQR]{style="color:#459B99;"} (2/2)

[**5 number summary**]{style="color:#8043F3"}

```{r}
summary(frog$clutch.volume)
```

$$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1 = 1096.5 - 609.6 = 486.9$$

 

::: columns
::: {.column width="38%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.height: 6
#| fig.width: 6

ggplot(frog, aes(x= clutch.volume)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Histograms of clutch volume")
```
:::

::: {.column width="62%"}
What is the IQR of the sepal widths?

```{r}
quantile(frog$clutch.volume, c(.25, .75))
diff(quantile(frog$clutch.volume, c(.25, .75)))
```

 

```{r}
IQR(frog$clutch.volume)
```
:::

## Robust estimates

Summary statistics are called [**robust estimates**]{style="color:#C83532"} if extreme observations have little effect on their values

| Estimate           | Robust? |
|--------------------|---------|
| Sample mean        | ❌      |
| Median             | ✅      |
| Standard deviation | ❌      |
| IQR                | ✅      |

-   For samples with many extreme values, the median and IQR might provide a more accurate sense of the center and spread
