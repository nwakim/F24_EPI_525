# (1.3) Data collection principles

*  Population vs. sample
* Sampling methods
*  Experiments vs. Observational studies


## Population vs. sample

\

### (Target) Population

* group of interest being studied
* group from which the sample is selected
  - studies often have _inclusion_ and/or _exclusion_ criteria

\

### Sample

* group on which data are collected
* often a small subset of the population


## Sampling methods (1/4) 

Goal is to get a __representative__ sample of the population:  
the characteristics of the sample are similar to the characteristics of the population

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
__Simple random sample (SRS)__  

* each individual of a population has the _same chance_ of being sampled
* randomly sampled
* considered best way to sample

![](/img_slides/sampleRandomHealthPlan.png){fig-align="center"}

:::
::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}
__Convenience sample__  

* easily accessible individuals are _more likely_ to be included in the sample than other individuals
* a common "pitfall"

![](/img_slides/sampleConvenienceHealthPlan.png){fig-align="center"}

:::
:::



## Sampling methods (2/4) 

_Good sampling plans don't guarantee samples representative of the population_

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
__Non-response bias__

* non-response rates can be high
* are all groups within a population being reached?
* unrepresentative sample  
=> skewed results

![](/img_slides/sampleNonResponseHealthPlan.png){fig-align="center"}

:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}
__"Random" samples can be unrepresentative by random chance__

* In a SRS each case in the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample
* But by random chance alone a random sample might contain a higher proportion of one group over another
* Ex: a SRS might by chance include 70% men (unlikely, but theoretically possible)

:::
:::

## Sampling methods (3/4) 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
* __Simple random sample (SRS)__
  * each individual of a population has the _same chance_ of being sampled
  * _statistical methods taught in this class assume a SRS!_

* __Stratified sampling__
  * divide population into groups (strata) before selecting cases within each stratum (often via SRS)
  * usually cases within a strata are similar, but are different from other strata with respect to the outcome of interest, such as gender or age groups
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](/img_slides/simple_stratified.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Sampling methods (4/4) 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
* __Cluster sample__
  * first divide population into groups (clusters)
  * then sample a fixed number of clusters, and include _all_ observations from chosen clusters
  * clusters are often hospitals, clinicians, schools, etc., where each cluster will have similar services/ policies/ etc. 
  * cases within clusters usually very diverse


* __Multistage sample__
  * similar to a cluster sample, but select a random sample within each selected cluster instead of all individuals
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](/img_slides/cluster_multistage.png){fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Experiments (1/2) 

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
* Researchers assign individuals to different __treatment__ or __intervention groups__
  * __control group__: often receive a __placebo__ or usual care
  * different treatment groups are often called __study arms__
* __Randomization__
  * group assignment is usually random to ensure similar (balanced) study arms for all variables (observed and unobserved)
  * randomization allows study arm differences in outcomes to be attributed to treatment rather than variability in patient characteristics
      * treatment is the only systematic difference between groups
      * establish causality
  * __blocking (stratification)__: group individuals into blocks (strata) before randomizing if there are certain characteristics that may influence the outcome other than treatment (i.e. gender, age group)

:::

## Experiments (2/2) 

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

* __Replication__
  * accomplished by collecting a sufficiently large sample
  * results usually more reliable with a large sample size
      * often less variability
      * more likely to be representative of population
* Some studies are not ethical to carry out as experiments
:::


## Observational studies 

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
* data are observed and recorded without interference
* often done via surveys, electronic health records, or medical chart reviews
* cohorts
* associations between variables can be established, but not causality
    * Individuals with different characteristics may also differ in other ways that influence response
* confounding variables (lurking variable)
  * variables associated with both the explanatory and response variables

* prospective vs. retrospective studies
:::

# (1.2) Intro to Data

![[Artwork by @allison_horst](https://allisonhorst.com/r-packages-functions)](/img_slides/horst_data_cowboy.png){fig-align="center"}



## How are data stored, how do we use them? 

- Often, data are in an Excel sheet, or a plain text file (.csv, .txt)
- .csv files open in Excel automatically, but actually are plain text
- Usually, columns are variables/measures and rows are observations (i.e. a person's measurements)

### Data in R 

* We can import data from many file types, including .csv, .txt., and .xlsx
    * We will cover this on a later date
* Once imported, R typically stores data as __data frames__, or __tibbles__ if using the `tidyverse` package (more on this later).
    * For our purposes, these are essentially the same, and I will tend to use the terms interchangeably.
    * These are examples of what we call __object types__ in R.



## Data frame example

::: columns
::: {.column width="54%"}

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  IDs=1:3, 
  gender=c("male", "female", "Male"), 
  age=c(28, 35.5, 31),
  trt = c("control", "1", "1"),
  Veteran = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
  )
df
```

* __Vectors__ vs. __data frames__
    * a data frame is a collection (or array or table) of vectors

:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="44%"}
::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
* Different columns can be of different data types (i.e. numeric vs. text)
* Both numeric and text can be stored within a column (stored together as *text*).

* Vectors and data frames are examples of _**objects**_ in R. 
  + There are other types of R objects to store data, such as matrices, lists.
:::
:::
:::


## Observations & variables

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

```{r}
df
```

![[ISLBS](https://www.openintro.org/book/biostat/)](/img_slides/Fig1.8_variable_types.png){fig-align="center"}

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
* Book refers to a dataset as a _data matrix_ 

* Rows are usually __observations__
* Columns are usually __variables__ 


* __[How many observations are in this dataset?]{style="color:green"}__

* __[What are the variable types in this dataset?]{style="color:green"}__
::: 
:::
:::




## Variable (column) types
::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
R type | variable type| description
---|---|---
integer | discrete | integer-valued numbers
double or numeric | continuous| numbers that are decimals
factor  | categorical | categorical variables stored with levels (groups)
character | categorical | text, "strings"
logical | categorical | boolean (TRUE, FALSE)

<!-- Each variable (column) in a data frame can be of a different type. -->

* View the __structure__ of our data frame to see what the variable types are:
:::
```{r}
str(df)
```

<!-- * Note that the ID column is _integer_ type since the values are all whole numbers, although we likely would think of it as being a categorical variable and thus prefer it to be a factor. -->




## Fisher's (or Anderson's) Iris data set 

Data description: 

* n = 150 
* 3 species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Virginica, and Versicolour)
  + 50 measurements of each type of Iris
* __variables__:
  + sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species

_[Can the iris species be determined by these variables?]{style="color:purple"}_

## View the `iris` dataset

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
* The `iris` dataset is already pre-loaded in *base* R and ready to use.
* Type the following command in the console window
  - _Warning: this command cannot be rendered. It will give an error._
:::

\

:::columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false

View(iris)
```
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
A new tab in the scripting window should appear with the `iris` dataset.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

![](/img_slides/screenshot_iris_View.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::


## Data structure

* What are the different __variable types__ in this data set?

\

```{r}
str(iris)   # structure of data
```




## Data set summary

```{r}
summary(iris)
```



## Data set info

```{r}
dim(iris)
nrow(iris)
ncol(iris)
names(iris)
```




## View the beginning or end of a dataset

```{r}
head(iris)
tail(iris)
```



## Specify how many rows to view at beginning or end of a dataset

```{r}
head(iris, 3)
tail(iris, 2)
```



## The `$`

- Suppose we want to single out the column of petal width values.
- One way to do this is to use the `$`
    * `DatSetName$VariableName`

```{r}
iris$Petal.Width
```



## Example using the `$`

The `$` is helpful if you want to create a new dataset for just that one variable, or, more commonly, if you want to calculate summary statistics for that one variable.

\

```{r}
mean(iris$Petal.Width)
sd(iris$Petal.Width)
median(iris$Petal.Width)
```



## Inline code

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
* With markdown you can also report __R code output inline__ with the text instead of using a chunk.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Text in editor:

![](/img_slides/screenshot_code_inline_petalwidth.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Output: 

The mean petal width for all 3 species combined is `r round(mean(iris$Petal.Width),1)` 
(SD = `r round(sd(iris$Petal.Width),1)`) cm.

:::
:::

- Reporting summary statistics this way in a report, makes the numbers computationally reproducible.
- For example, if this were for an abstract and a year later you are wondering where the numbers came from, your R code will tell you exactly which dataset was used to calculate the values.

## Measures of center: mean

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
__[Sample mean]{style="color:darkorange"}__: the average value of observations

$$\overline{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{x_i}{n}$$  

where $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ represent the $n$ observed values in a sample


__Example__: What is the mean age in the toy dataset `df` defined earlier?
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false


df <- data.frame(
  IDs=1:3, 
  gender=c("male", "female", "Male"), 
  age=c(28, 35.5, 31),
  trt = c("control", "1", "1"),
  Veteran = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
  )
df
```


```{r}
df
mean(df$age)
```



## Measures of center: median

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
* The __[median]{style="color:darkorange"}__ is the middle value of the observations in a sample.  

* The median is the 50th percentile, meaning
  - 50% of observations lie below and
  - 50% of observations lie above the median.
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
* If the number of observations is 
  - odd: the median is the middle observed value
  - even: the median is the average of the two middle observed values
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
df$age
median(df$age)
median(c(df$age, 67))
```

:::
:::


## Measures of center: mean vs. median

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 14

iris_long <- iris %>% pivot_longer(Sepal.Length:Petal.Width, names_to = "msr")

ggplot(iris_long, aes(x= value)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(msr)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Iris sepal and petal lengths & widths")

```

```{r}
summary(iris)
```


## Measures of center: mode

__[mode]{style="color:darkorange"}__: the most frequent value in a dataset

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.height: 6
#| fig.width: 14

ggplot(iris_long, aes(x= value)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(msr)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Iris sepal and petal lengths & widths")

```



## Measures of spread: standard deviation (SD) (1/3) 

__standard deviation__ is (approximately) the average distance between a typical observation and the mean 

- An observation's **deviation** is the distance between its value $x$ and the sample mean $\overline{x}$: deviation = $x - \overline{x}$.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 14

sim_diff_sd <- data.frame(
  id = 1:100,
  sd1 = rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 10),
  sd2 = rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 30),
  sd3 = rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 50)
)

sim_diff_sd_long <- sim_diff_sd %>%
  pivot_longer(sd1:sd3, names_to = "sd")

ggplot(sim_diff_sd_long, aes(x= value)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(sd)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Simulated data with different standard deviations")

```



## Measures of spread: SD  (2/3) 

- The **sample variance** $s^2$ is the sum of squared deviations divided by the number of observations minus 1.
$$s^2 = \frac{(x_1 - \overline{x})^2+(x_2 - \overline{x})^2+\cdots+(x_n - \overline{x})^2}{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1}$$
    where $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ represent the $n$ observed values.

- The **standard deviation** $s$ is the square root of the variance.
$$s = \sqrt{\frac{({x_1 - \overline{x})}^{2}+({x_2 - \overline{x})}^{2}+\cdots+({x_n - \overline{x})}^{2}}{n-1}} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1}}$$




## Measures of spread: SD  (3/3) 

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Let's calculate the sample standard deviation for our toy example
:::

```{r}
df$age

```

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
mean(df$age)
sd(df$age)
```

:::
:::

$s = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1}} =$

<!-- \sqrt{\frac{({28 - 31.5)}^{2}+({35.5 - 31.5)}^{2}+({31 - 31.5)}^{2}}{3-1}} = 3.775 -->



## Empirical Rule: one way to think about the SD (1/2) 

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
For symmetric bell-shaped data, about

* 68% of the data are within 1 SD of the mean
* 95% of the data are within 2 SD's of the mean
* 99.7% of the data are within 3 SD's of the mean

These percentages are based off of percentages of a true normal distribution.

## Empirical Rule: one way to think about the SD (2/2)

::: columns

```{r}
#| fig.height: 8
hist(iris$Sepal.Width)

```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
mean(iris$Sepal.Width)
sd(iris$Sepal.Width)
```

:::
:::


## Measures of spread: interquartile range (IQR) (1/2) 

The $p^{th}$ percentile is the observation such that $p\%$ of the remaining observations fall below this observation.

  - The *first quartile* $Q_1$ is the $25^{th}$ percentile.
  - The *second quartile* $Q_2$, i.e., the median, is the $50^{th}$ percentile.
  - The *third quartile* $Q_3$ is the $75^{th}$ percentile.
    
The __[interquartile range (IQR)]{style="color:darkorange"}__ is the distance between the third and first quartiles.
$$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$

* IQR is the width of the *middle half* of the data



## Measures of spread: IQR (2/2)

__[5 number summary]{style="color:darkorange"}__
```{r}
summary(iris$Sepal.Width)
```

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.width: 5

hist(iris$Sepal.Width)
```

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
What is the IQR of the sepal widths?

```{r}
quantile(iris$Sepal.Width, c(.25, .75))
diff(quantile(iris$Sepal.Width, c(.25, .75)))

IQR(iris$Sepal.Width)
```

## Robust estimates

Summary statistics are called __[robust estimates]{style="color:darkorange"}__ if extreme observations have little effect on their values
