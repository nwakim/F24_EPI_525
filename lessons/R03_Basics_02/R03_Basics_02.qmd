## Last time

- Downloaded R and Rstudio
- If you are still having issues downloading, please come to my office hours!
- Became familiar with the console and a script file
- Did some math calculations in R!

 


### Today, we're going to work on...

- Assigning things in R
- Using functions to calculate 
- Familiarizing ourselves with common issues
- Troubleshooting with different tools
- Go over an example dataset

## Where are we?

![](../img_slides/course_map.png){fig-align="center"}

## We will open RStudio on our computer (not R!)

![[Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html#using-r-via-rstudio)](../img_slides/01_md_r.png){fig-align="center"}

```{css, echo=FALSE}
.reveal code {
  max-height: 100% !important;
}
```

## RStudio anatomy

## Variables (saved R objects)

Variables are used to store data, figures, model output, etc.

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
-   Can assign a variable using either `=` or `<-`
    -   **Using `<-` is preferable** for certain occasions
    -   I usually just use `=` because less typing hehe

Assign just one value:

```{r}
x = 5
x
x <- 5
x
```
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}
Assign a **vector** of values

-   Consecutive integers using `:`

```{r}
a <- 3:10
a
```

-   **Concatenate** a string of numbers

```{r}
b <- c(5, 12, 2, 100, 8)
b
```
:::
:::

## Let's try it out!

-   Create a new variable `y` that is assigned the value of 8
-   Create a new variable `c` that is assigned the vector of values 15 through 20
-   Create a new variable `d` that is assigned the vector of values 16 through 19 and 22.

 

-   Did you notice anything in the `Environment` section of Rstudio?

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(3)
```

## Doing math with variables

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Math using variables with just one value

```{r}
x <- 5
x

x + 3

y <- x^2
y
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Math on vectors of values:\
**element-wise** computation

```{r}
a <- 3:6
a

a+2; a*3

a*a
```
:::
:::

## Let's try it out!

-   Use the variable name `y` to find the addition of `y` and 5
-   Add 5 to the vector `c`

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(2)
```

## Variables can include text (characters)

```{r}
hi <- "hello"
hi

greetings <- c("Guten Tag", "Hola", hi)
greetings
```

## Using functions

-   `mean()` is an example of a function
-   functions have "arguments" that can be specified within the `()`
-   `?mean` in console will show help file for `mean()`

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Function <font color="#BF396F">arguments specified</font> by name:

```{r}
mean(x = 1:4)
```

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 12, by = 3)
seq(by = 3, to = 12, from = 1)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Function <font color="#BF396F">arguments not specified</font>, but listed in order:

```{r}
mean(1:4)
```

```{r}
seq(1, 12, 3)
```
:::
:::

## Now let's use some functions for summary statistics

-   We will calculate the mean for `c`
-   Let's also calculate the standard deviation for `c`
    -   Recall, our function is `sd()`
    -   Use `?sd` in the console to identify the arguments for `c`

 

-   If you have more time, you can try to calculate the median and IQR for `c`

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(3)
```

## Common console errors (1/2)

**Incomplete commands**

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   When the console is waiting for a new command, the prompt line begins with `>`
    -   If the console prompt is `+`, then a previous command is incomplete
    -   You can finish typing the command in the console window
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Example:

```{r}
#| error: true
#| message: true
#| warning: true
#| prompt: true
3 + (2*6
)
```
:::
:::

## Common console errors (2/2)

**Object is not found**

-   This happens when text is entered for a non-existent variable (object)

Example:

```{r}
#| error: true
hello
```

-   Can be due to missing quotes

```{r}
#| error: true
install.packages(dplyr) 
# correct code is: install.packages("dplyr")
```

# Getting help with R

## There are many ways to get help when you are stuck

1. [Use the `?` in front of the function name to get more information!]{style="color:#BF396F;"}
  
    -   Usually if I need help with the arguments for a function

2. [Google or go to stackoverflow.com]{style="color:#3070BF;"}
  
    - Often when I Google, I get redirected to something like stackoverflow
    - For example, let's say my `mean` function was outputting `NA`. I would Google something like "keep getting NA for mean in R" Then end up [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25297705/mean-na-rm-true-still-returns-na)

3. [I can also go to my favorite AI tool to get help]{style="color:#459B99;"}
  
    - This is most useful for getting code started if it's complicated (we're not really at that level yet)
    - I asked ChatGPT "can you give me the code for calculating the mean in R"
        - [This is what I got](https://chatgpt.com/share/66f8a2b9-9918-8006-88af-0dc7b64bb86a)
    - For code generation, it gives you WAY too much
    - I also asked ChatGPT "Why is the mean function in R giving me an NA?" (in above link)
    
## More on AI usage

- [In the syllabus](https://nwakim.github.io/F24_EPI_525/syllabus.html#plagiarism-and-attribution)
- If you cannot trace code back to the class notes, then do NOT use it!
  - There's different coding practices and functions out there
  - I'm giving you a specific set of tools that will serve as a good introduction
  - You should be able to explain all your code and work 


# Let's try with an example dataset

## Fisher's (or Anderson's) Iris data set

Data description:

-   n = 150
-   3 species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Virginica, and Versicolour)
    -   50 measurements of each type of Iris
-   **Variables**:
    -   sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species

## View the `iris` dataset

-   The `iris` dataset is already pre-loaded in *base* R and ready to use.
-   Type the following command in the console window
    -   *Warning: this command cannot be rendered. It will give an error.*

 

::: columns
::: {.column width="37%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false

View(iris)
```

A new tab in the scripting window should appear with the `iris` dataset.

## Data structure (1/2)

-   What are the different **variable types** in this data set?

- We are going to use the `str` function

  - Can you use the console to tell me what we can input into `str`?


## Data structure (2/2)

-   What are the different **variable types** in this data set?

- We are going to use the `str` function

  - Can you use the console to tell me what we can input into `str`?

\

```{r}
str(iris)   # structure of data
```

## Data set summary

-   Can we quickly summarize all the data?

```{r}
summary(iris)
```

## Data set info

-   You can use different functions to find information on a data frame

```{r}
dim(iris)
nrow(iris)
ncol(iris)
names(iris)
```

-   We can also look at the `Environment` section

## Take a moment to find the information on the iris data frame

- Go to environment section to see the `iris` data frame

## View the beginning or end of a dataset

- These commands can be helpful if the data frame has a lot of rows
```{r}
head(iris)
tail(iris)
```

## Specify how many rows to view at beginning or end of a dataset

```{r}
head(iris, 3)
tail(iris, 2)
```

## The `$`

- Suppose we want to single out the column of petal width values.
- One way to do this is to use the `$`
    * `DatSetName$VariableName`

```{r}
iris$Petal.Width
```



## Example using the `$`

The `$` is helpful if you want to create a new dataset for just that one variable, or, more commonly, if you want to calculate summary statistics for that one variable.

\

```{r}
mean(iris$Petal.Width)
sd(iris$Petal.Width)
median(iris$Petal.Width)
```



## Inline code

* With markdown you can also report __R code output inline__ with the text instead of using a chunk.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Text in editor:**

![](../img_slides/screenshot_code_inline_petalwidth.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Output:** 

The mean petal width for all 3 species combined is `r round(mean(iris$Petal.Width),1)` 
(SD = `r round(sd(iris$Petal.Width),1)`) cm.

:::
:::

- Reporting summary statistics this way in a report, makes the numbers computationally reproducible.
- For example, if this were for an abstract and a year later you are wondering where the numbers came from, your R code will tell you exactly which dataset was used to calculate the values.
