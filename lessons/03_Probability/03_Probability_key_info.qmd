## Announcements

- [R for the Rest of Us](https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/getting-started)
  - A fellow student reminded me of this great resource! 
  - If you want to get refreshers on R, please use this!
  - It's free, but I think you need to sign up
- Using OneDrive for other class materials
- When we get to HW where we work with R will you indicate that we should use R for that question?
  - Yes! Homework 1 should not need any R, but in later homeworks I will tell you!
