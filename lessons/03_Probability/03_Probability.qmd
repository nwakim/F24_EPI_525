## Let's start with an example!

**Example: Rolling fair 6-sided dice**
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose you roll a fair 6-sided die.

1.  What is the probability that you roll a 4?

2.  What is the probability that you roll an even number?

3.  What is the probability that you did not roll a 3?

## What is a probability?

::: definition
::: def-ttl
Definition: Probability
:::

::: def-cont
How likely something will happen. 

- On a more technical note, the
probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would
occur if the random phenomenon could be observed an infinite number of
times.
:::
:::

-   We can think of flipping a coin. There are two possible outcomes
    (heads or tails). The probability of getting heads is 0.5. 

## What is a probability? with the Law of Large Numbers

-   We can think of flipping a coin. There are two possible outcomes
    (heads or tails). The probability of getting heads is 0.5. 

    - If we flip the coin 10 times, it is not certain that we will get 5 heads.
    However, if we flip it infinite times, we will get heads 50% of the
    flips. 

 
  
- [Fun "Seeing Theory"
    demonstration!](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html)

::: definition
::: def-ttl
Law of large numbers
:::

::: def-cont
As more observations are collected, the proportion of occurrences,
$\hat{p}$, with a particular outcome converges to the true probability
$p$ of that outcome.

## Poll Everywhere Question 1

## Some probability notation

-   Probability typically defined as a proportion
    -   Takes values between 0 and 1
    
 
    
-   Probability can also be expressed as a "percent chance," taking
    values between 0% and 100%

     

-   If we want to discuss the probability of an event, say A, we would
    write $P(A)$
    -   We can write: $A = \{\text{rolling a 1}\}$, with associated
        probability $P(A)$
    -   OR we can write $P(\text{rolling a 1})$

## Disjoint / mutually exclusive events

::: definition
::: def-ttl
Disjoint / mutually exclusive events
:::

::: def-cont
Two events or outcomes are called **disjoint** or **mutually exclusive**
if they cannot both happen at the same time.
:::
:::

## Poll Everywhere Question 2

## Probability for disjoint events

::: green
::: green-ttl
Probability rule for disjoint events
:::

::: green-cont
If $A_1$ and $A_2$ represent two disjoint outcomes, then the probability
that either one of them occurs is given by
$$P(A_1\text{ or } A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2)$$

If there are $k$ disjoint outcomes $A_1$, ..., $A_k$, then the
probability that either one of these outcomes will occur is
$$P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \cdots + P(A_k)$$
:::
:::

::: columns
::: column
-   From the poll everywhere question with the die, what is the
    probability of event A or B?

## Probabilities when events are not disjoint

-   When events are not disjoint, we cannot use the previous addition
    rule for probabilities!!

-   We must use a general rule that recognizes the potential overlap
    between events

::: green
::: green-ttl
General probability addition rule
:::

::: green-cont
If $A$ and $B$ are any two events, disjoint or not, then the probability
that at least one of them will occur is \begin{eqnarray}
P(A\text{ or }B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\text{ and }B),
\label{generalAdditionRule}
\end{eqnarray} where $P(A$ and $B)$ is the probability that both events
occur.
:::
:::

## Think back to our die

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   Event A and D are not disjoint, they share an outcome of rolling a 2
-   How do we find the probability of event A or event D?
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

## Probability distributions

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
-   A **probability distribution** consists of all disjoint outcomes and
    their associated probabilities
-   We've already seen one [in our heads and tails
    example](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html)

::: green
::: green-ttl
Rules for a probability distribution
:::

::: green-cont
A probability distribution is a list of all possible outcomes and their
associated probabilities that satisfies three rules:

1.  The outcomes listed must be disjoint
2.  Each probability must be between 0 and 1
3.  The probabilities must total to 1

## Complement of an event

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
We need two math definitions for this:

-   **Sample space:** denoted as $S$ is the set of all possible
        outcomes

-   **Complement:** complement of an event, say D, represents all
        the outcomes in the sample space that are not in D

    -   Complement is denoted as $D^c$ or $D'$
    
::: green
::: green-ttl
Complement
:::
::: green-cont
The complement of event $A$ is denoted $A^c$, and $A^c$ represents all outcomes not in $A$. $A$ and $A^c$ are mathematically related: \vspace{-2mm}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{complement}
P(A) + P(A^c) = 1, \quad\text{i.e.}\quad P(A) = 1-P(A^c).
\end{eqnarray}

::: {.column width="40%"}

:::

## Independence

- Two processes are **independent** if knowing the outcome of one provides no information
about the outcome of the other

- For example, if we flip two different coins and one lands on heads, what does that tell us about the other coin? 

::: green
::: green-ttl
Multiplication Rule for independent processes
:::
::: green-cont
If $A$ and $B$ represent events from two different and independent processes, then the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur is given by: \vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqForIndependentEvents}
P(A \text{ and }B) = P(A)  P(B).
\end{eqnarray}
Similarly, if there are $k$ events $A_1$, ..., $A_k$ from $k$ independent processes, then the probability they all occur is\vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A_1) P(A_2) \cdots P(A_k).
\end{eqnarray*}

## Poll Everywhere Question 3

# Learning Objectives

1. Define probability and explain the Law of Large Numbers within examples

2. Define relationships between events and their probability properties (including disjoint events, non-disjoint events, complements, and independent events)

::: lob
3. Calculate an unknown probability in a word problem using the probability properties
:::

## Example rolling two dice

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
What is the probability that both dice will be 1? 
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

## General steps for probability word problems

1. Define the events in the problem and make a Venn Diagram

2. Translate the words and numbers into probability statements

3. Translate the question into a probability statement

4. Think about the various definitions and rules of probabilities. Is there a way to define our question's probability statement (in step 3) using the probability statements with assigned values (in step 2)?

5. Plug in the given numbers to calculate the answer!

## Weekly medications

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

::: example
::: ex-ttl
Example 3
:::

::: ex-cont
If a subject has an

-   80% chance of taking their medication *this* week,

-   70% chance of taking their medication *next* week, and

-   10% chance of *not* taking their medication *either* week,

then find the probability of them taking their medication exactly one of the two weeks.
