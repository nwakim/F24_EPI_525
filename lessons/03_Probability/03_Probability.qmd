## Let's start with an example!

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
::: example
::: ex-ttl
**Example: Rolling fair 6-sided dice**
:::

::: ex-cont
1.  Suppose you roll a fair 6-sided die.

    a.  What is the probability that you roll a 4?

    b.  What is the probability that you roll an even number?

    c.  What is the probability that you did not roll a 3?

2.  Suppose you roll **two** fair 6-sided dice.

    a.  What is the probability that you roll a 2 with the first die and
        a 5 with the second die?

## What is a probability?

::: definition
::: def-ttl
Definition: Probability
:::

::: def-cont
How likely something will happen. On a more technical note, the
probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would
occur if the random phenomenon could be observed an infinite number of
times.
:::
:::

-   We can think of flipping a coin. There are two possible outcomes
    (heads or tails). The probability of getting heads is 0.5. If we
    flip the coin 10 times, it is not certain that we will get 5 heads.
    However, if we flip it infinite times, we will get heads 50% of the
    flips. [Fun seeing theory
    demonstration!](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html)

::: definition
::: def-ttl
Law of large numbers
:::

::: def-cont
As more observations are collected, the proportion of occurrences,
$\hat{p}$, with a particular outcome converges to the true probability
$p$ of that outcome.
:::
:::

## Some probability notation

-   Probability typically defined as a proportion
    -   Takes values between 0 and 1
-   Probability can also be expressed as a "percent chance," taking
    values between 0% and 100%
-   If we want to discuss the probability of an event, say A, we would
    write $P(A)$
    -   We can write: $A = \{\text{rolling a 1}\}$, with associated
        probability $P(A)$
    -   OR we can write $P(\text{rolling a 1})$

## Disjoint / mutually exclusion events

::: definition
::: def-ttl
Disjoint / mutually exclusion events
:::

::: def-cont
Two events or outcomes are called **disjoint** or **mutually exclusive**
if they cannot both happen at the same time.
:::
:::

## Poll Everywhere Question 1

## Probability for disjoint events

::: green
::: green-ttl
Probability rule for disjoint events
:::

::: green-cont
If $A_1$ and $A_2$ represent two disjoint outcomes, then the probability
that either one of them occurs is given by
$$P(A_1\text{ or } A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2)$$

If there are $k$ disjoint outcomes $A_1$, ..., $A_k$, then the
probability that either one of these outcomes will occur is
$$P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \cdots + P(A_k)$$
:::
:::

::: columns
::: column
-   From the poll everywhere question with the die, what is the
    probability of event A or B?
:::

::: column
![](/lessons/img_slides/disjointEvents.png){fig-align="right"
width="440"}
:::
:::

## Probabilities when events are not disjoint

-   When events are not disjoint, we cannot use the previous addition
    rule for probabilities!!

-   We must use a general rule that recognizes the potential overlap
    between events

::: green
::: green-ttl
General probability addition rule
:::

::: green-cont
If $A$ and $B$ are any two events, disjoint or not, then the probability
that at least one of them will occur is \begin{eqnarray}
P(A\text{ or }B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\text{ and }B),
\label{generalAdditionRule}
\end{eqnarray} where $P(A$ and $B)$ is the probability that both events
occur.
:::
:::

## Think back to our die

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   Event A and D are not disjoint, they share an outcome of rolling a 2
-   How do we find the probability of event A or event D?
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
![](/lessons/img_slides/disjointEvents.png){fig-align="right"}
:::

## Probability distributions

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
-   A **probability distribution** consists of all disjoint outcomes and
    their associated probabilities
-   We've already seen one [in our heads and tails
    example](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html)

::: green
::: green-ttl
Rules for a probability distribution
:::

::: green-cont
A probability distribution is a list of all possible outcomes and their
associated probabilities that satisfies three rules:

1.  The outcomes listed must be disjoint
2.  Each probability must be between 0 and 1
3.  The probabilities must total to 1

## Complement of an event

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
We need two math definitions for this:

-   **Sample space:** denoted as $S$ is the set of all possible
        outcomes

-   **Complement:** complement of an event, say D, represents all
        the outcomes in the sample space that are not in D

    -   Complement is denoted as $D^c$ or $D'$
    
::: green
::: green-ttl
Complement
:::
::: green-cont
The complement of event $A$ is denoted $A^c$, and $A^c$ represents all outcomes not in $A$. $A$ and $A^c$ are mathematically related: \vspace{-2mm}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{complement}
P(A) + P(A^c) = 1, \quad\text{i.e.}\quad P(A) = 1-P(A^c).
\end{eqnarray}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](/lessons/img_slides/complementOfD.png){fig-align="center"
width="790"}
:::

## Independence

- Two processes are **independent** if knowing the outcome of one provides no information
about the outcome of the other

- For example, if we flip two different coins and one lands on heads, what does that tell us about the other coin? 

::: green
::: green-ttl
Multiplication Rule for independent processes
:::
::: green-cont
If $A$ and $B$ represent events from two different and independent processes, then the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur is given by: \vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqForIndependentEvents}
P(A \text{ and }B) = P(A)  P(B).
\end{eqnarray}
Similarly, if there are $k$ events $A_1$, ..., $A_k$ from $k$ independent processes, then the probability they all occur is\vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A_1) P(A_2) \cdots P(A_k).
\end{eqnarray*}
:::
:::

## Example rolling two dice

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
What is the probability that both dice will be 1? 
:::

## Let's go through a slightly more complicated example?

Maybe venn diagram or some other TB example??
