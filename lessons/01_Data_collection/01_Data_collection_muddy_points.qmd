## Our long delayed example of cluster sampling, stratified sampling, and multistage

This answer comes from our sweet, sweet friend, ChatGPT: 

Hereâ€™s a set of examples focused on **studying patient satisfaction within a single hospital**:

### 1. **Cluster Sampling:**
   **Example**: A researcher wants to assess patient satisfaction within a large hospital but cannot survey every patient. The researcher could:
   
   - Divide the hospital into **floors** (clusters).
   - Randomly select a few floors.
   - Survey **all patients** on the selected floors.

### 2. **Stratified Sampling:**
   **Example**: The researcher wants to ensure representation of patients from different **types of care** (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, emergency). The researcher could:
   
   - Divide the patients into **strata based on the type of care** they received.
   - Then, randomly select patients from each care category to ensure proportional representation in the sample.

### 3. **Multistage Sampling:**
   **Example**: To study patient satisfaction within the hospital, the researcher could use multistage sampling:
   
   - **First stage**: Randomly select **departments** (e.g., Oncology, Surgery, Cardiology).
   - **Second stage**: Randomly select **wards** or **units** within each department (e.g., ICU, general ward).
   - **Final stage**: Randomly select **patients** from each unit to survey about their satisfaction with the care received.

This example is specific to a single hospital, using different sampling techniques to focus on patient satisfaction within various departments and care types.

### Now back to Nicky

One of the key pieces of info here is that we are sampling **patients**! In the cluster sampling, we survey all patients in our randomly chosen cluster. In stratified, we set the subgroups, but we only sample some of the patients in each subgroup!

In multistage, there is a step where we randomly chose different clusters (like the department or wards) THEN we randomly select patients within those chosen clusters. Each stage can be identified with a different sampling technique (outside of multistage). Can you map each stage to their respective sampling method?
