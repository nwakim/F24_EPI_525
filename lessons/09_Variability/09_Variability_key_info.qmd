## Announcements

-   [Check out the R resources if you need them!](https://nwakim.github.io/F24_EPI_525/syllabus.html#r-statistical-computing-software)
    -   I just added a new one that seems really helpful: [Data and Analytics for Research Training Program](https://arcus.github.io/education_modules/list_of_modules)

## Key Dates

-   HW 04 assignment due Friday
-   HW 03 solutions due Sunday (still worth 12 points)
    -   I will select **one problem from this assignment for everyone to make solutions on**
        -   You may still work in a group, but everyone will submit their own solution
        -   It will be on 3.22
        -   I decided this because I thought it would be unfair to have one group member have extra work with this problem
-   HW 03 videos are due on 11/12 at 11pm
    -   Or scheduled meeting with me on the week of 11/11
