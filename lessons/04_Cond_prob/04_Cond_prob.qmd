2. Mathematically define probability properties that relate to conditional probability (general multiplication rule, independence and conditional probability, and Bayes' theorem)

3. Apply probability properties to solve a world problem on positive predictive value (PPV)

## Example: hypertension prevalence (1/2)

-   US CDC estimated that between 2011 and 2014[^1], 29% of the population in America had hypertension

 

-   A health care practitioner seeing a new patient would expect a 29% chance that the patient might have hypertension
    -   However, this is **only the case if nothing else is known about the patient**

[^1]: <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db220.htm>

## Example: hypertension prevalence (2/2)

- Prevalence of **hypertension varies significantly with age**
    - Among adults aged 18-39, 7.3% have hypertension
    - Adults aged 40-59, 32.2%
    - Adults aged 60 or older, 64.9% have hypertension

 

-   Knowing the age of a patient provides important information about the likelihood of hypertension
    - Age and hypertension status are **not independent** (we will get into this)
    
-   While the probability of hypertension of a randomly chosen adult is 0.29...
    
    -   The **conditional probability** of hypertension in a person known to be 60 or older is 0.649

How can we assemble the full picture of hypertension and age with probabilities?
:::

## Contingency tables 

- We can start looking at the **contingency table** for hypertension for different age groups
  - **Contingency table:** type of data table that displays the frequency distribution of two or more categorical variables
  
```{r}
#| echo: false

# Create the table data
hyp_data <- data.frame(
  Age_Group = c("18-39 years", "40 to 59 years", "Greater than 60 years", "Total"),
  Hypertension = c(8836, 42109, 39917, 90862),
  No_Hypertension = c(112206, 88663, 21589, 222458),
  Total = c(121042, 130772, 61506, 313320)
)

# Generate table using kable
kable(hyp_data, col.names = c("Age Group", "Hypertension", "No Hypertension", "Total"), 
      caption = "Table: Contingency table showing hypertension status and age group, in
thousands.")
```

-   [**Joint probability**]{style="color:#E75B5C;"}
    
    -   In first row, shows that in the entire population of 313,320,000, approximately 8,836,000 people were aged 18-39 years and had hypertension (~2.8%)

- [**Marginal probability**]{style="color:#BF396F;"}
    
    - We can say that in the entire population of 313,320,000, approximately 121,042,000 people are 18-39 years (~38.6%)

- [**Conditional probability**]{style="color:#367B79;"} 
    
    - But we can also say the first row shows that of 121,042,000 people who are 18-39 years, 8,836,000 people had hypertension (~7.3%)

## Poll Everywhere Question 1

## Probability tables

::: lob
**We typically display joint and marginal probabilities in probability table**
:::

 

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Create the table data
hyp_prob <- data.frame(
  Age_Group = c("18-39 years", "40 to 59 years", "Greater than 60 years", "Total"),
  Hypertension = c(0.0282, 0.1344, 0.1274, 0.2900),
  No_Hypertension = c(0.3581, 0.2830, 0.0689, 0.7100),
  Total = c(0.3863, 0.4174, 0.1963, 1)
)

# Generate table using kable
kable(hyp_prob, col.names = c("Age Group", "Hypertension", "No Hypertension", "Total"), 
      caption = "Table: Probability table summarizing hypertension status and age group.")
```

- [**Joint probability**]{style="color:#E75B5C;"}: intersection of row and column
    
- [**Marginal probability**]{style="color:#BF396F;"}: row or column total

## Let's go back to conditional probability

- So far we have intuitively thought of conditional probability and used the **contingency table**: 
  - The first row shows that of 121,042,000 people who are 18-39 years, 8,836,000 people had hypertension (~7.3%)
- We got this from: $$P(\text{hypertension} | \text{18-39 years old}) = \dfrac{8,836,000}{121,042,000} = 0.073$$
  - "$\text{hypertension} | \text{18-39 years old}$" reads as "hypertension given 18-39 years old"

Can we calculate the conditional probability from the **probability table**?

# Learning Objectives

1.  Recognize joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities in contingency and probability tables

::: lob
2. Mathematically define probability properties that relate to conditional probability (general multiplication rule, independence and conditional probability, and Bayes' theorem)
:::

3. Apply probability properties to solve a world problem on positive predictive value (PPV)

## We can define conditional probability more mathematically

- Let's define some events:
  - $A$ = hypertension
  - $B$ = 18-39 years old
  
$$P(\text{hypertension} | \text{18-39 years old}) = P(A | B) =  \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

::: definition
::: def-ttl
Conditional probability
:::
::: def-cont
The conditional probability of an event A given an event or condition B is:
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$
:::
:::

## So if we had a table of probabilities for our example...

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false

# Create the table data
hyp_prob <- data.frame(
  Age_Group = c("18-39 years", "40 to 59 years", "Greater than 60 years", "Total"),
  Hypertension = c(0.0282, 0.1344, 0.1274, 0.2900),
  No_Hypertension = c(0.3581, 0.2830, 0.0689, 0.7100),
  Total = c(0.3863, 0.4174, 0.1963, 1)
)

# Generate table using kable
kable(hyp_prob, col.names = c("Age Group", "Hypertension", "No Hypertension", "Total"), 
      caption = "Table: Probability table summarizing hypertension status and age group.")
```

 

::: lob
What is the probability of hypertension for someone aged 18-39 years old?
:::

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
::: pink
::: pink-ttl
Recall
:::
::: pink-cont
- $A$ = hypertension
- $B$ = 18-39 years old
- $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$
:::
:::

:::
:::

## General multiplication rule

::: definition
::: def-ttl
General multiplication rule
:::
::: def-cont
If $A$ and $B$ represent two outcomes or events, then $$P(A \cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$$
:::
:::

This follows from rearranging the definition of conditional probability: $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \rightarrow P(A|B)P(B) = P(A \cap B)$$


## Independence and conditional probability

- If two events, say A and B, are **independent**, then: $$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$

- We can extend this to conditional probability: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
  - For two independent events, say A and B, $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A)P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A)$$

::: green
::: green-ttl
Conditional probability of independent events
:::
::: green-cont
If events A and B are independent, then 
$$P(A|B) =P(A) \text{ and } P(B|A) = P(B)$$
:::
:::

## Poll Everywhere Question 2

## Bayes' Theorem (Section 2.2.5)

::::: red
::: red-ttl
Bayes' Theorem
:::

::: red-cont
In its simplest form: $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$
:::
:::::

This also translates to: $$P(A | B) = 
\frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}
{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) }$$ 
because of the **Law of Total Probability**: $$\begin{aligned}P(B) = & P(B \cap A) + P(B \cap A^C) \\ = &P(B | A)P(A)+ P(B|A^C)P(A^C) \end{aligned}$$

"Based on the results of a clinical study where the iHealth® COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test was compared to an FDA authorized molecular SARS-CoV-2 test, iHealth® COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test correctly identified 94.3% of positive specimens and 98.1% of negative specimens." In October 2022, 83.8 people per 100k in Multnomah County with Covid-19. 

Suppose you take the iHealth® rapid test.

1.  What is the probability of a positive test result?

2.  What is the probability of having COVID-19 if you get a positive test result?

3.  What is the probability of not having COVID-19 if you get a negative test result?

## Some specialized terminology in diagnostic tests

Calculating probabilities for diagnostic tests is done so often in medicine that the topic has some specialized terminology

- The **sensitivity** of a test is the probability of a positive test result
when disease is present, such as a positive mammogram when a patient has breast cancer.
- The **specificity** of a test is the probability of a negative test result when disease is absent
- The probability of disease in a population is referred to as the **prevalence**. 
- With specificity and sensitivity information for a particular test, along with disease prevalence, the **positive predictive value (PPV)** can be calculated: the probability that disease is present when a test result is positive.
- Similarly, the **negative predictive value** is the probability that disease is absent when test results are negative

## Poll Everywhere Question 3

## General steps for probability word problems

1. Define the events in the problem and draw a Venn Diagram
