-   Question from student: Confused about the phrasing of the variables in question 1.4 of our homework. 
    -   "Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10."
    -   Are all variables to be assumed to be on a scale from 0 to 10? 
        -   Answer: Yes!
    -   Is activity supposed to be read as type of activity or activity level?
        -   Based on the scale from 1 to 10, I'd say activity level
