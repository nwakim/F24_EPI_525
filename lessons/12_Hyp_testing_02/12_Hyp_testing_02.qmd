2.  Construct confidence intervals for the mean difference in paired data and interpret these intervals in the context of the research question.
3.  Perform the appropriate hypothesis test for paired data and interpret the results.

## What are paired data?

- **Paired data:** two sets of observations are uniquely paired so that an observation in one set matches an observation in the other

 

- Examples
  -   Enroll pairs of identical twins to study a disease
  -   Enroll people and collect data before & after an intervention (longitudinal data)
  -   Textbook example: Compare maximal speed of competitive swimmers wearing a wetsuit vs. wearing a regular swimsuit

 

- Paired data result in a **natural measure of difference**
  - Example: Enroll parent and child pairs to study cholesterol levels
    - We can look at the difference in cholesterol levels between parent and child
    
## For paired data: Population parameters vs. sample statistics

 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

[__Population parameter__]{style="color:#C83532;"}

- Mean difference: $\delta$ ("delta", lowercase)
- Standard deviation: $\sigma_d$ ("sigma")

::: {.column width="50%"}
[__Sample statistic (point estimate)__]{style="color:#EF85B3;"}

- Sample mean difference: $\overline{x}_d$
- Sample standard deviation: $s_d$

- Using $d$ helps us distinguish between a single sample and paired data

## Can a vegetarian diet change cholesterol levels?

-   [**We will illustrate how to perform a hypothesis test and calculate a confidence interval for paired data as we work through this example**]{style="color:#5BAFF8"}
-   **Scenario**:
    -   43 non-vegetarian people were enrolled in a study and were instructed to adopt a vegetarian diet
    -   Cholesterol levels were measured before and after the vegetarian diet
    
 
    
::: lob
**Question**: Is there evidence to support that cholesterol levels changed after the vegetarian diet?
:::

-   How do we answer this question?
    -   First, calculate changes (differences) in cholesterol levels
        -   We usually do after - before if the data are longitudinal
    - Then find CI or perform hypothesis test 
        
## EDA: Explore the cholesterol data

- Read in the data with `read.csv()`
```{r}
chol <- read.csv(here::here("data", "chol213_n40.csv"))
```

- Take a look at the variables with `glimpse()`
```{r}
glimpse(chol)
```

 

- Get summary statistics with `get_summary_stats()`
```{r}
chol %>% get_summary_stats(type = "common") %>% 
  gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 40)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

chol_long <- chol %>% 
  # need an ID column for the plot
  # make it factor so that coloring is not on continuous scale
  mutate(ID = factor(1:n())) %>% 
  # make data long for plot: 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = Before:After,
    names_to = "Time",  # need a column for Before & After on x-axis
    values_to = "Cholesterol") %>% # need a column of all cholesterol values for y-axis
  mutate(
    # change Time a factor variable so that can reorder
    # levels so that Before is before After
    Time = factor(Time, levels = c("Before", "After"))
    )
```

## EDA: Cholesterol levels before and after vegetarian diet

- Behind the scenes: I changed the data from wide to long format to make this plot (to be covered in R08)

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-align: center

ggplot(chol_long, aes(x = Cholesterol)) + geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ Time, ncol = 1) +
  labs(y = "Number of individuals", x = "Cholesterol level (mg/dL)")
```

## EDA: Differences in cholesterol levels: After - Before diet

- How do we calculate the difference in cholesterol levels?

- I can create a new variable called "DiffChol" using the `mutate()` function (look more closely at this in R08)

 

```{r}
#| fig.width: 10
#| fig.height: 3
chol <- chol %>% 
  mutate(DiffChol = After - Before) 
glimpse(chol)
```

       x = "Difference in cholesterol level (mg/dL)")
```
:::
:::::

## Same distribution: single-sample mean & paired mean difference (1/2)

- Even though we are looking at a difference, we have a single sample mean to represent the difference
  - Before, we had single sample mean $\overline{x}$
  - Now we have a sample mean difference $\overline{x}_d$ 

 

- Distribution for the mean difference for paired data is the same as the distribution for a single mean 
  - Use the t-distribution to build our inference

 

- We can use the same procedure for confidence intervals and hypothesis testing as we did for the single-sample mean

## 95% CI for the mean difference in cholesterol levels

```{r}
chol %>% 
  select(DiffChol) %>% 
  get_summary_stats(type = "common") %>%

95% CI for population mean difference $\delta$:

```{r}
#| include: false
n <- 43
alpha <- 0.05
(p_area <- 1-alpha/2)
(xbar <- mean(chol$DiffChol))
(sd <- sd(chol$DiffChol))
(tstar <- qt(p_area, df=n-1))  # df = n-1

Used $t^*$ = `qt(0.975, df=42)` = `r round(qt(0.975, df=42),3)`

 

Conclusion:\
We are 95% confident that the (population) mean difference in cholesterol levels after a vegetarian diet is between `r round(LB, 3)` mg/dL and `r round(UB, 3)` mg/dL.

## 95% CI for the mean difference in cholesterol levels (using R)

- We can use R to get those same values 

```{r}
t.test(x = chol$DiffChol, mu = 0)
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: We can tidy the output
t.test(x = chol$DiffChol, mu = 0) %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>% 
  tab_options(table.font.size = 35) # use a different size in your HW
```

Conclusion:\
We are 95% confident that the (population) mean difference in cholesterol levels after a vegetarian diet is between `r round(LB, 3)` mg/dL and `r round(UB, 3)` mg/dL.



## Poll Everywhere Question 2

# Learning Objectives

1.  Define paired data and explain how it differs from independent samples in the context of statistical analysis.
2.  Construct confidence intervals for the mean difference in paired data and interpret these intervals in the context of the research question.

::: lob
3.  Perform the appropriate hypothesis test for paired data and interpret the results.
:::

## Reference: Steps in a Hypothesis Test

1.  Check the [**assumptions**]{style="color:#3070BF"}

2.  Set the [**level of significance**]{style="color:#3070BF"} $\alpha$

3.  Specify the [**null**]{style="color:#3070BF"} ( $H_0$ ) and [**alternative**]{style="color:#3070BF"} ( $H_A$ ) [**hypotheses**]{style="color:#3070BF"}

    1.  In symbols
    2.  In words
    3.  Alternative: one- or two-sided?

4.  Calculate the [**test statistic**]{style="color:#3070BF"}.

5.  Calculate the [**p-value**]{style="color:#3070BF"} based on the observed test statistic and its sampling distribution

6.  Write a [**conclusion**]{style="color:#3070BF"} to the hypothesis test

    1.  Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
    2.  Write a conclusion in the context of the problem

## Step 1: Check the [**assumptions**]{style="color:#3070BF"}

-   The assumptions to run a hypothesis test on a sample are:

    -   **Independent pairs**: Each pair is independent from all other pairs,
    -   **Approximately normal sample or big n**: the distribution of the sample should be approximately normal, *or* the sample size should be at least 30

 

-   These are the criteria for the Central Limit Theorem in Lesson 09: Variability in estimates

 

-   In our example, we would check the assumptions with a statement:

    -   The pairs of observations are independent from each other and the number of pairs in our sample is 43. Thus, we can use CLT to approximate the sampling distribution.

## Step 2: Set the [**level of significance**]{style="color:#3070BF"} $\alpha$

-   **Before doing a hypothesis test**, we set a cut-off for how small the $p$-value should be in order to reject $H_0$.

-   Typically choose $\alpha = 0.05$

 

- See Lesson 11: Hypothesis Testing 1: Single-sample mean

## Step 3: Null & Alternative Hypotheses (1/2)

In statistics, a **hypothesis** is a statement about the value of an **unknown population parameter**.

A [**hypothesis test**]{style="color:#3070BF"} consists of a test between two competing hypotheses:

1.  a [**null**]{style="color:#3070BF"} hypothesis $H_0$ (pronounced “H-naught”) vs.
2.  an [**alternative**]{style="color:#3070BF"} hypothesis $H_A$ (also denoted $H_1$)

Example of hypotheses in words:

\begin{aligned}
H_0 :& \text{The population mean difference in cholesterol levels after a vegetarian diet is zero}\\
\text{vs. } H_A :& \text{The population mean difference in cholesterol levels after a vegetarian diet is} \\
& \text{ different than zero}
\end{aligned}

1.  $H_0$ is a claim that there is "no effect" or "no difference of interest."
2.  $H_A$ is the claim a researcher wants to establish or find evidence to support. It is viewed as a "challenger" hypothesis to the null hypothesis $H_0$

:::::::: columns
::: {.column width="32%"}
$H_A: \delta \neq \delta_0$

:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="32%"}
$H_A: \delta < \delta_0$

-   believe the population mean difference is **less** than the null value $\delta_0$
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="32%"}
$H_A: \delta > \delta_0$

-   believe the population mean difference is **greater** than the null value $\delta_0$

::::::::

-   $H_A: \delta \neq \delta_0$ is the most common option, since it's the most conservative

## Step 4: Test statistic (where we do not know population sd)

From our example: Recall that $\overline{x}_d = -21.767$, $s_d=13.89$, and $n=43$

```{r}
#| include: false
n <- 43
alpha <- 0.05
mu <- 0
(p_area <- 1-alpha/2)
xbar <- mean(chol$DiffChol)
(sd <- sd(chol$DiffChol))
(se <- sd/sqrt(n))

tstat <- (xbar - mu)/se
pt(tstat, df=n-1)
2*(pt(tstat, df=n-1))
```

The test statistic is:

$$
t_{\overline{x}_d} = \frac{\overline{x}_d - \delta_0}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}}
= \frac{`r round(xbar, 3)` - 0}{\frac{`r round(sd, 3)`}{\sqrt{`r n`}}}
= `r round(tstat, 3)`
$$

-   Statistical theory tells us that $t_{\overline{x}}$ follows a **Student's t-distribution** with $df = n-1 = 42$

```{r}
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 10
#| fig-align: center
#| echo: false
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-12, 12)), aes(x)) + 
  stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = 42)) + 
  ylab("") + 
  xlab("t-dist with df = 42") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-10.276,10.276), 
             color = "red")
```


## Step 5: p-value

The [**p-value**]{style="color:#BF396F"} is the **probability** of obtaining a test statistic *just as extreme or more extreme* than the observed test statistic assuming the null hypothesis $H_0$ is true.

#| fig.width: 9

#| echo: false
# specify upper and lower bounds of shaded region below
mu <- 0
std <- se

# The following figure is only an approximation of the 
# sampling distribution since I used a normal instead
# of t-distribution to make it.

ggplot(data.frame(x = c(mu-6*std, mu+6*std)), aes(x = x)) + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mean = mu, sd = std)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(mu, mu - 3.4*(1:6), mu + 3.4*(1:6))) +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = -30, hjust = 0), 
        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  labs(y = "", 
       x = "Sample mean difference",
       title = "Sampling distribution of mean difference") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-xbar, xbar), 
             color = "red")
```

```{r}
#| fig.height: 3.6
#| fig.width: 9
#| echo: false
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-12, 12)), aes(x)) + 
  stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = n-1)) + 
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  xlab("t-dist with df = 42") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(mu, mu - (1:12), mu + (1:12))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-tstat,tstat), 
             color = "red")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Calculate the *p*-value using the **Student's t-distribution** with $df = n-1 = 43-1=42$:

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
\text{p-value} &=P(T \leq -10.276) + P(T \geq 10.276)\\
&= 4.946032 \times 10^{-13} < 0.001

2*pt(-10.276, df = 43-1,

## Step 4-5: test statistic and p-value together using `t.test()`

- I will have reference slides at the end of this lesson to show other options

```{r}
t.test(x = chol$DiffChol, mu = 0)
```

- We can "tidy" the results
```{r}
t.test(x = chol$DiffChol, mu = 0) %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>% 
  tab_options(table.font.size = 40) # use a different size in your HW
```

-   Need to compare p-value to our selected $\alpha = 0.05$
-   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?

## Step 6: Conclusion to hypothesis test

\begin{aligned}
H_0 &: \delta = 0\\

\end{aligned}

-   Recall the $p$-value = $`r tidy(t.test(x = chol$DiffChol, mu = 0))$p.value`$
-   Use $\alpha$ = 0.05.
-   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?

**Conclusion statement**:

-   Stats class conclusion (and good enough for our class!)
    -   There is sufficient evidence that the (population) mean difference in cholesterol levels after a vegetarian diet is different from 0 mg/dL ( $p$-value \< 0.001).
-   More realistic manuscript conclusion:
    -   After a vegetarian diet, cholesterol levels decreased by on average `r round(abs(xbar), 2)` mg/dL (95% CI: `r round(abs(tidy(t.test(x = chol$DiffChol, mu = 0))$conf.high), 2)`, `r round(abs(tidy(t.test(x = chol$DiffChol, mu = 0))$conf.low), 2)`), which is discernably different than 0 ($p$-value \< 0.001).

6.  **Conclusion:** We reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence that cholesterol levels decreased with the vegetarian diet ( $p$-value \< 0.001).

# Reference: Ways to run a paired t-test in R

## R option 1: Run a 1-sample `t.test` using the paired differences

$H_A: \delta \neq 0$

```{r}
t.test(x = chol$DiffChol, mu = 0)
```

[*Run the code without `mu = 0`. Do the results change? Why or why not?*]{style="color:#BF396F"}

## R option 2: Run a 2-sample `t.test` with `paired = TRUE` option

$H_A: \delta \neq 0$

-   For a 2-sample t-test we specify both `x=` and `y=`
-   Note: `mu = 0` is the default value and doesn't need to be specified

```{r}
t.test(x = chol$Before, y = chol$After, mu = 0, paired = TRUE)
```
