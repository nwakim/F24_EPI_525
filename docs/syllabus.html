<section id="description" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Welcome to EPI 525! This course covers a broad range of basic statistical methods used in the health sciences. We will start with a review of descriptive statistics and introductory probability, then explore probability and sampling distributions, central limit theorem, and confidence intervals. These topics will be followed by basic hypothesis testing framework, along with the appropriate power and sample size considerations. We will also cover large-sample hypothesis tests for means, proportions and variances, and some exact tests. Students will be introduced to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation and simple linear regression in preparation for BSTA 512/612. Most homework assignments are to be completed using R.</p>
<section id="course-learning-objectives" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-learning-objectives">Course Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>At the end of this course, students should be able to…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Show how the data relate to the question of interest</li>
<li>Select appropriate statistical methods for estimation and testing to answer a given question of interest and use computer software to implement those methods</li>
<li>Communicate and interpret your statistical findings and conclusions to a non-statistician in a manner consistent with the context of the original research question</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="slack">Slack</h4>
<p>We will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. If you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask me by posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack.</p>
<p><a href="https://join.slack.com/t/epi525f24/shared_invite/zt-2q9fpa8h3-Yc5U91Ps0MjnemADzTM5Vw">**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**</a></p>
<p><strong>Tips on asking questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When reaching out for help for a homework problem, please include some context on what you have already tried.
<ul>
<li>For example, including a photo of your work thus far with an explanation of where you think you might be wrong is a quick way for me to look over your work and help you troubleshoot. This helps me see what parts you already understand and which you need help with. If your question involves code, please <strong>include the copied code (not a screenshot)</strong> and an attachment to your full file. This way I can see the exact line you need help with and the full code in case the problem starts earlier.</li>
<li>If you are unsure how to start a problem, look through your notes and the book for examples that you think might be similar. When reaching out, mention these examples and why you think they might be helpful, but also why you are still unsure on how to proceed.</li>
<li>If you only write something similar to “I don’t know how to do problem xxx,” then my response will be to ask you what you tried so far. Thus, it will be quicker for you to let me know this information right away.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If asking for help about a specific example that you don’t understand, please also provide some detail beyond “I don’t understand example xxx.”
<ul>
<li>Which steps of the problem do you not understand? You can refer to a line number, for example.</li>
<li>If you don’t understand the first step, do you understand the ones following it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In general, when asking a question, please provide the homework number it is from along with the chapter and problem number. If it’s an example from the notes or book, an example number or slide number will help finding it.</li>
<li>Want more tips on asking questions? This list on <a href="https://www.weareteachers.com/8-ways-to-pose-better-questions-in-math-class/" class="uri">this site</a> will help!</li>
<li>Finally, if I don’t respond within a day and you need a response soon, <em>please remind me by emailing or messaging me again</em>.</li>
</ul>

<section id="sakai" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sakai">Sakai</h4>
<p>While most course materials will be delivered online through this website, assignments will be turned in through <a href="https://sakai.ohsu.edu/">Sakai</a>, OHSU’s course management system. I will include a link on this website to the Sakai assignment page.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="webex" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="webex">Webex</h4>
<p>Webex software will be used for virtual office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, I recommend the following best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please stay muted until you want to participate</li>
<li>During office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like “I have a question.” This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone’s questions in order.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="poll-everywhere" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="poll-everywhere">Poll Everywhere</h4>
<p>We will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and me (Nicky) on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.</p>
</section>
<section id="r-statistical-computing-software" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-statistical-computing-software">R: Statistical Computing Software</h4>
<p>You will use statistical software to complete <strong>later</strong> homework assignments. In the second half of the course, you will be required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely downloaded. <a href="https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html">Helpful documentation</a> on installing R is available. <strong>I encourage you to install R prior to attending our first lecture, but we will have 30 minutes at the end of our first class to troubleshoot.</strong> Please email me if you need help installing R or RStudio.</p>
<p>You will need to download the following three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>R <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://www.r-project.org/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Rstudio <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" class="uri">https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/</a></p></li>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-r-resources">Additional R Resources</h5>
<p>Your learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in R.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-assessments">Types of assessments</h4>
<p>This class will use a combination of formative and summative assessments to build and test our knowledge. Below I define each of these types of assessments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Formative assessment:</strong> Activity or work meant to help students learn and practice. Feedback on these assessments are meant to help the instructor and student identify gaps in knowledge and highlight accomplishments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summative assessment:</strong> Work meant to test how well students have achieved learning objectives. Grading of these assessments are meant to gauge how well a student grasps the learning objectives and will be able to use their knowledge outside of the classroom.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="homework-grading">Homework grading</h3>
<p>No student has the same amount of time available to dedicate to homework. This class may not be a priority to you, you may be taking several other courses, or you may need to dedicate time to other activities. Homework assignments are <strong>formative assessments</strong>, meaning its purpose is to help you learn and practice. To reduce the pressure on you to have perfect homework (the first time around), I have a very simple grading policy: <strong>Your homework will be given a check mark if you turn in completed work (whether it is correct or wrong).</strong> I highly encourage you to stay up-to-date with the homeworks and put in as much effort as you can. This will be the most helpful work in this class!</p>
<p>Because each homework assignment has dependent assignments (solutions and presentations), I will not accept late homework. If you have an accomodation, then there are exceptions to this. If you turn it in a couple hours after the assignment is closed, that is fine! The main reason why I have this strict rule is so that you do not get behind on your homework nor prevent your group from moving forward on the solutions.</p>

<li><p>For homework, I ask you to email me and the TAs directly about any late submissions. You can explain your circumstances and may ask us for an extension. I am very likely to grant an extension, but <strong>I want to emphasize how important it will be to stay on track with your homework</strong>! Your group is depending on you, and delaying homework may only add stress on the next homework!</p></li>
<li><p>For homework, you will have TWO no-questions-asked, 3-day extensions: one for the first assignment part and one for either the solutions or presentation. Please use this wisely!

<p>In this class, it is easy to use ChatGPT or other AI tools to solve your homework for you. Many problems follow a basic structure that is especially easy for ChatGPT to solve. In this class, you <strong>may</strong> use ChatGPT to help with your homework. You may even ask for direct answers. However, there are a few things I do not want you to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Do not copy ChatGPT’s answer directly into your homework.</strong> Your homework is graded for full credit if you turn it in, in any state, so turning in ChatGPT’s answers is unacceptable. I rather see half-written answers that show what you’re thinking than see a correct answer from ChatGPT.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not stop once ChatGPT answered a question.</strong> If it gives an explanation, interact with it! Make sure you understand the thought process of ChatGPT. Try writing out the process to help cement it in your head. Check the answer with what we learn in class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not use ChatGPT on our quizzes!</strong> Hence, you need to really understand how to solve these problems even if you use ChatGPT on the homework.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, ChatGPT is a resource that will be available to you in a job and outside of school. Thus, we should use it as a tool in school as well! Let me know if ChatGPT helped you understand something! I would love to incorporate it into future classes!</p>

<p>You can think of this class as assembling a toolbox. When a handyperson starts working for the first time, they need to acquire new tools. For their first few jobs, they might need help finding their tools, or remembering which tool is best used for what action. Eventually, they get to know their tools well, and using them appropriately becomes second nature.</p>
<p><strong>For now, ChatGPT can help us find and use our tools, but we need to work towards using them as second nature!</strong></p>

<p><u><em>Inclusive &amp; supportive learning community</em></u><br>
I believe that learning happens best when we all learn together, as a community. This means creating a space characterized by generous listening, civility, humility, patience, and hospitality. I will attempt to promote a safe climate where we examine content from multiple perspectives. I will strive to create and maintain a classroom atmosphere in which you feel free to both listen to others and express your views and ask questions to increase your learning.</p>
<p><u><em>Openness to feedback</em></u><br>
I appreciate straightforward feedback from you regarding how well the class is meeting your needs. Let me know if material is not clear or when its relevance to the student learning outcomes for the course is not apparent. In particular, let me know if you identify bias or stereotyping in my teaching materials as I will seek to continuously improve. Please also let me know if there’s an aspect of the class you find particularly interesting, helpful, or enjoyable!</p>
<p><u><em>Responsiveness<br>
</em></u>I will monitor email as well as the discussion board daily and try respond to all messages within 24 hours Monday-Friday.</p>

</strong>You are expected to attend at least 12 scheduled class meetings in-person. Attendance is taken through exit tickets. If you have issues accessing the poll on a specific day, please let me know.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><em>Participate<strong><br>
</strong></em></u>I encourage you to participate actively in class and in Slack discussions. I will expect all students, and all instructors, to be respectful of each other’s contributions, whether I agree with them or not. Professional interactions are expected.</p>
<p><u><em>Build rapport</em></u><br>
If you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let me know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing me when difficulties arise during the quarter so that I can help you find a solution in regards to coursework.</p>
<p><u><em>Complete assignments</em></u><br>
All assignments for this course will be submitted electronically through Sakai unless otherwise instructed. I encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand that sometimes circumstances arise that are beyond our control. If you need an extension, please contact me in congruence with the Late Policy.</p>
<p><u><em>Seek help if you need it</em></u><strong><br>
</strong>I believe it is important to support the physical and emotional well‐being of my students. If you are experiencing physical and/or mental health issues, I encourage you to use the resources on campus such as those listed below.

You should speak with or email me before or during the first week of classes regarding any special needs. Students seeking academic accommodations should register with the appropriate service under the School policies below.</p>
<p>Some religious holidays may occur on regularly scheduled class days. Because available class hours are so limited in number, we will have to hold class on all such days. Class video recordings will be available and you are encouraged to engage with the material outside of the regular class time. Please email me about your absence. I will excuse the absece from your grade. You are also encouraged to come to office hours with questions from the session.</p>
<p><u><em>Commit to integrity</em></u><strong><br>
</strong>As a student in this course (and at PSU or OHSU) you are expected to maintain high degrees of professionalism, commitment to active learning and participation in this class and also integrity in your behavior in and out of the classroom.</p>
<p>Cheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated in this course and will be dealt with firmly. Student academic misconduct refers to behavior that includes plagiarism, cheating on assignments, fabrication of data, falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library materials), or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts. Preparation of exams, assigned on an individual basis, must represent each student’s own individual effort. When used, resource materials should be cited in conventional reference format.</p>

<p><strong>Sakai/Slack announcements<br>
</strong>For important/urgent matters, I will communicate with you using announcements via Sakai that will be delivered to your OHSU Email account as well as displayed in the Sakai course site Announcements section. I will copy these announcements in Slack if they do not involve changes to the schedule. Unfortunately, there are certain announcements that OHSU requires I initiate behind the firewall.</p>
<p><strong>General course questions<br>
</strong>It is normal to have many questions about things that relate to the course, such as clarification about assignments, course materials, or assessments. Please post these on our Slack Workspace. Please use the channels that I created for questions. You are encouraged to give answers and help each other. I will monitor these threads, so I will endorse or correct responses as needed. Please give me 24 hours to respond to questions within Monday-Friday. Work-life balance is important for me as well, so I will try to respond as quickly as I can within my healthy limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>E-mail</strong><br>
E-mail should be used only for messages that are private in nature. Please send private messages to my OHSU email address (wakim@ohsu.edu). <strong>Messages sent through Sakai Inbox will not be answered.</strong> Do not send messages asking general information about the class; please post those on Slack instead.</p>
