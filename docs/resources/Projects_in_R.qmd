* I *highly, highly, HIGHLY* recommend using R Projects to organize your analyses and make it easier to load data files and also save output.
* When you create an R Project on your computer, the Project is associated with the folder (directory) you created it in. 
  * This folder becomes the "root" of your working directory, and RStudio's point of reference from where to load files from and to. 
* I create separate Projects for every analysis project and every class I teach. 
* You can run multiple sessions of RStudio by opening different Projects, and the environments (or working directory) of each are working independently of each other. 

:::{.callout-note}
* Although we are using Quarto files, 
    * I will show how to set up and use a __"regular" R Project__
    * instead of "Quarto Project"
* Quarto Projects include extra features and thus complexity. Once you are used to how regular R Projects work, you can try out a Quarto Project.

:::{.callout-warning}
* Many (if not most) of the resources below refer to RMarkdown instead of Quarto files to create reproducible reports. 
* This is not a problem. Projects work the same way with Quarto files.
