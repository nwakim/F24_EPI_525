It occurs most often in young adults, age 10 - 19; it is diagnosed in approximately 8 per 1,000,000 individuals per year in that age group. In New York City (including all five boroughs), the number of young adults in this age range is approximately 1,400,000.__\n\n### a {.unnumbered}\n\n__What is the expected number of cases of osteosarcoma in NYC in a given year?__\n\n::: blue\n11.2\n:::\n\n### b {.unnumbered}\n\n__What is the probability that 15 or more cases will be diagnosed in a given year?__\n\n::: blue\n0.161\n:::\n\n### c {.unnumbered}\n\n__The largest concentration of young adults in NYC is in the borough of Brooklyn, where the population in that age range is approximately 450,000.

An official from the NYC Public Health Department claims that the probability of this event (that is, the probability of 10 or more cases being observed, and all of them occurring in Brooklyn) is what was calculated in part c). Is the official correct? Explain your answer. You may assume that your answer to part c) is correct. This question can be answered without doing any calculations.__\n\n::: blue\nOfficial is not correct\n:::\n\n### e {.unnumbered}\n\n__Suppose that over five years, there was one year in which 10 or more cases of osteosarcoma were observed in Brooklyn.
