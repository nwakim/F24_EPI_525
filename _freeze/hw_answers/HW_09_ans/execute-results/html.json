One Drive does not show the math correctly!!\n:::\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<style>\ndiv.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}\n</style>\n```\n\n\n# Book exercises {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## 8.28 True or false, Part II {.unnumbered}\n\n### (a)  {.unnumbered}\n\nTRUE.\n\n### (b)  {.unnumbered}\n\nTRUE. \n\n\n### (c)  {.unnumbered}\n\nFALSE.    \n\n### (d)  {.unnumbered}\n\nFALSE.    \n\n## 8.34 Coffee and Depression {.unnumbered}\n\n### (a)\n\n### (b)-(f)\nInstead of doing part (b) - (f), please run a hypothesis test using the Chi-squared test. \n\n\n\n### (g)\n\n## 5.46 Child care hours {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n## 5.48 True/False: ANOVA, Part II {.unnumbered}\n\n# R exercise\n\n## Load all the packages you need below here. \n\n## R1: Palmer Penguins ANOVA\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\ndata(penguins)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Dotplots\n\n__Make a dotplot of the penguins' bill depths stratified by species type. Include points for the mean of each species type as well as a horizontal dashed line for the overall mean.__ _See example from class for the plot I'm describing._\n\n\n### Technical conditions\n\n__Investigate whether the technical conditions for using an ANOVA been satisfied. __\n\n### Which groups significantly different?\n\n__Based on the figure, which pairs of species look like they have significantly different mean bill depths?__ \n\n\n### Hypotheses in symbols or words\n\n__Write out in symbols or words the null and alternative hypotheses.__  \n\n\n\n### Run ANOVA in R\n\n__Using R, run the hypothesis test and display the output.__  \n\n\n### F statistic\n\n__Using the values from the ANOVA table, verify (calculate) the value of the F statistic.__ \n\n\n### Decision?\n\n__Based on the p-value, will we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis? Why?__\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\n__Write a conclusion to the hypothesis test in the context of the problem.__\n\n# Nonparametric-Tests\n\n\n## NPT 1: (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test\n\n__Vegetarian diet and cholesterol levels__\n\nWhen covering paired t-tests on Day 10 Part 2, the class notes used the example of testing whether a vegetarian diet changed cholesterol levels. The data are in the file `chol213.csv` at <https://niederhausen.github.io/BSTA_511_F23/data/chol213.csv>. In this exercise we will use non-parametric tests to test for a change and compare the results to the paired t-test.\n\n\n### Hypotheses\n\n__What are the hypotheses for the signed-rank test (2-sided) in the context of the problem?__ \n\n### Test in R\n\n__Run the (Wilcoxon) Signed-rank test in R. What is the  p-value and how does it compare to the p-value of the sign test and the paired t-test (check the class notes for this)?__ \n\n\n## 8.38 (a) & (extra) Salt intake and CVD {.unnumbered}\n\nDo **not** do parts (b)-(c) in the book\n\n### (a) {.unnumbered}\n\n* __You can use the expected cell counts from `expected()` in R (you do not need to compute them using the formula).__\n* __Comment on whether the sample size condition is met or not for these data.__\n\n### (extra) {.unnumbered}\n\n__Run a Fisher's Exact test. Include the hypotheses and a conclusion in the context of the problem.__\n\n\n\n# Extra R exercises (optional)\n\n## R2: Palmer Penguins SLR\n\n\n### Scatterplots\n\n* __For each of the following pairs of variables, make a scatterplot showing the best fit line and describe the relationship between the variables.__\n* In particular address \n  * whether the association is linear, \n  * how strong it is (based purely on the plot), and \n  * what direction (positive, negative, or neither).\n\n1. __body mass vs. flipper length__\n\n\n\n2. __bill depth vs. flipper length__\n\n\n\n3. __bill depth vs. bill length__\n\n\n\n### Correlations\n\n* __For each of the following pairs of variables, find the correlation coefficient $r$.__\n\n1. __body mass vs. flipper length__\n\n\n\n2. __bill depth vs. flipper length__\n\n\n3. __bill depth vs. bill length__\n\n\n### Compare associations\n\n __Which pair of variables has the strongest association? Which has the weakest? Explain how you determined this.__\n\n\n### Body mass vs. flipper length SLR\n\n__Run the simple linear regression model for body mass vs. flipper length, and display the regression table output.__\n\n\n### Regression equation\n\n__Write out the regression equation for this model, using the variable names instead of the generic $x$ and $y$, and inserting the regression coefficient values.__\n\n### Interpret intercept \n\n__Write a sentence interpreting the intercept for this example. Is it meaningful in this example?__ \n\n\n### Interpret slope\n\n__Write a sentence interpreting the slope for this example.__ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
