Calculate the power for the hypothesis test and include an interpretation of the power in the context of the research question. Was it sufficiently powered? \n\n\n\n### Sample size\n\nFor the same test, what sample size would be needed for 80% power? Would it be reasonable to conduct the study with these sample sizes? Why or why not? (Hint: think about the assumptions of our distributions when using a t-test)\n\n\n### Effect size\n\nSuppose the study has resources to include 30 people. What minimum effect size would they be able to detect with 85% power assuming the same sample mean and standard deviation. Use $\\alpha$ = 0.05. \n\n# R work\n\n## Load appropriate packages here\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\nhere() starts at /Users/wakim/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-OregonHealth&ScienceUniversity/Teaching/Classes/F24_EPI_525/F24_EPI_525_site\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## R1: Swim times\n\n* In these exercises you will use R to work through the swim times example from Section 5.2 in the textbook. \n* The data are in the `oibiostats` package and called `swim`.\n\n\n### Mean & SD of differences \n\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation for the differences in swim times, and compare them to the ones in the book. Which order were the differences calculated, wet suit - swim suit or the opposite? Were all the differences positive? \n\n\n### Dot plot of differences\n\nCreate a histogram of the differences in swim times and comment on the distribution shape. \n\n\n### Hypothesis test\n\nRun the appropriate statistical test in R as both a one-sample t-test and a paired t-test to verify the test statistic, p-value, and CI in the text. Use inline R code to pull these values from the test output when writing up your comparison of these values to the book's values. \n\n## R2: 2-sample independent t-test\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npd = read.csv(here(\"data\", \"parkinsons.csv\"))\n```\n:::\n",
