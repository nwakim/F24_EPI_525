Note that rendering automatically saves your Qmd file and rendering frequently helps you catch your errors more quickly.\n:::\n\n\n# Book exercises {.unnumbered}\n\n## 5.26 Egg volume {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n## 5.34 Placebos without deception {.unnumbered}\n\n\n# PSS\n\n## PSS1: 4.22 Testing for food safety.\n\nDo exercise 4.22 from textbook.\n\n\n## PSS2: Auto exhaust and lead exposure revisited.\n\n### Power\n\n__In exercise 5.12, we tested whether police officers appear to have been exposed to a higher concentration of lead than 35. Calculate the power for the hypothesis test and include an interpretation of the power in the context of the research question. Was it sufficiently powered?__ \n\n\n\n### Sample size\n\n__For the same test, what sample size would be needed for 80% power? How about 90% power? Would it be reasonable to conduct the study with these sample sizes? Why or why not?__ \n\n\n\n### Effect size\n\n__Suppose the study has resources to include 30 people. What minimum effect size would they be able to detect with 85% power assuming the same sample mean and standard deviation. Use $\\alpha$ = 0.05.__ \n\n\n\n### 2-sided vs. 1-sided \n\n__Continuing with the previous question, what happens to the effect size they can detect if the test is two sided instead of one-sided?__ \n\n\n\n## PSS3: Legalize Marijuana, Part III. \n\n### Power\n\n__<font color=\"green\">In exercise 8.8 (e), we tested whether the proportion of US residents who think marijuana should be made legal is different than 0.586. Calculate the power for the hypothesis test and include an interpretation of the power in the context of the research question. Was it sufficiently powered?</font>__ \n\n\n\n\n### Sample size\n\n__<font color=\"green\">For the same test, what sample size would be needed for 80% power? How about 90% power?</font>__ \n\n\n\n\n### Effect size\n__<font color=\"green\">If we increase the sample size, and keep the power and significance level the same, does the effect size increase or decrease? Why? </font>__ \n\n",
