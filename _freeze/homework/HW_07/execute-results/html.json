Note that rendering automatically saves your Qmd file and rendering frequently helps you catch your errors more quickly.\n:::\n\n## Complete the group evaluation\n\nPlease complete the group evaluation form by the homework assignment due date.\n\n<https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=V3lz4rj6fk2U9pvWr59xWFMopmPUjRtDiHLswhgacNhUQ0JOQjRaQkpPNFpPSlBKVjJUMDdMTkFRNi4u>\n\n# Book exercises\n\n\n## 5.16 Paired or not, Part II {.unnumbered}\n\n## 5.22 DDT exposure {.unnumbered}\n\n## 5.26 Egg volume {.unnumbered}\n\nMaybe skip this one\n\n## 5.34 Placebos without deception {.unnumbered}\n\n## 4.22 Testing for food safety {.unnumbered}\n\n# Non-book exercises\n\n## Power and Sample size: Auto exhaust and lead exposure revisited\n\n### Power\n\nIn exercise 5.12 in Homework 6, we tested whether police officers appear to have been exposed to a higher concentration of lead than 35. Calculate the power for the hypothesis test and include an interpretation of the power in the context of the research question. Was it sufficiently powered? \n\n\n\n### Sample size\n\nFor the same test, what sample size would be needed for 80% power? Would it be reasonable to conduct the study with these sample sizes? Why or why not? (Hint: think about the assumptions of our distributions when using a t-test)\n\n\n### Effect size\n\nSuppose the study has resources to include 30 people. What minimum effect size would they be able to detect with 85% power assuming the same sample mean and standard deviation. Use $\\alpha$ = 0.05. \n\n\n## R1: Swim times\n\n* In these exercises you will use R to work through the swim times example from Section 5.2 in the textbook. \n* The data are in the `oibiostats` package and called `swim`.\n\n\n### Mean & SD of differences \n\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation for the differences in swim times, and compare them to the ones in the book. Which order were the differences calculated, wet suit - swim suit or the opposite? Were all the differences positive? \n\n\n### Dot plot of differences\n\nCreate a histogram of the differences in swim times and comment on the distribution shape. \n\n\n### Hypothesis test\n\nRun the appropriate statistical test in R as both a one-sample t-test and a paired t-test to verify the test statistic, p-value, and CI in the text. Use inline R code to pull these values from the test output when writing up your comparison of these values to the book's values. \n\n## R2: 2-sample independent t-test\n",
