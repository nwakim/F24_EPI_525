Calculate the power for the hypothesis test and include an interpretation of the power in the context of the research question. Was it sufficiently powered?__ \n\n\n\n### Sample size\n\n__For the same test, what sample size would be needed for 80% power? How about 90% power? Would it be reasonable to conduct the study with these sample sizes? Why or why not?__ \n\n\n\n### Effect size\n\n__Suppose the study has resources to include 30 people. What minimum effect size would they be able to detect with 85% power assuming the same sample mean and standard deviation. Use $\\alpha$ = 0.05.__ \n\n\n\n### 2-sided vs. 1-sided \n\n__Continuing with the previous question, what happens to the effect size they can detect if the test is two sided instead of one-sided?__ \n\n\n\n## PSS3: Legalize Marijuana, Part III. \n\n### Power\n\n__<font color=\"green\">In exercise 8.8 (e), we tested whether the proportion of US residents who think marijuana should be made legal is different than 0.586. Calculate the power for the hypothesis test and include an interpretation of the power in the context of the research question. Was it sufficiently powered?</font>__ \n\n\n\n\n### Sample size\n\n__<font color=\"green\">For the same test, what sample size would be needed for 80% power? How about 90% power?</font>__ \n\n\n\n\n### Effect size\n__<font color=\"green\">If we increase the sample size, and keep the power and significance level the same, does the effect size increase or decrease? Why? </font>__ \n\n\n## R2: Swim times\n\n* In these exercises you will use R to work through the swim times example from Section 5.2 in the textbook. \n* The data are in the `oibiostats` package and called `swim`.\n\n\n### Mean & SD of differences \n\n__Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the differences in swim times, and compare them to the ones in the book. Which order were the differences calculated, wet suit - swim suit or the opposite? Were all the differences positive?__ \n\n\n### Dot plot of differences\n\n__Create a dot plot of the differences in swim times and comment on the distribution shape.__ \n\n\n### Hypothesis test\n\n__Run the appropriate statistical test in R as both a one-sample t-test and a paired t-test to verify the test statistic, p-value, and CI in the text. Use inline R code to pull these values from the test output when writing up your comparison of these values to the book's values.__ \n\n\n## R1: DDS expenditures by ethnicity\n\n* In these exercises you will use R to work through the discrimination in developmental disability support example from Section 5.3.4 (pg. 253) in the textbook. \n* The data are in the `oibiostats` package and called `dds.discr`.\n\n\n\n### New dataset\n\n__Create a new dataset that only includes the White (non Hispanic) and Hispanic ethnicities. Use this new dataset for the following questions.__ \n\n\n\n### Data viz\n\n__Create density plots and box plots of the expenditures stratified by ethnicity. Comment on the distribution shapes. Are there any outliers?__ \n\n\n\n### t-test conditions\n\n__Are the conditions for a t-test comparing the mean expenditures of the two ethnicities satisfied?__ \n\n\n\n### Log-transformation\n\n__The book recommends log-transforming the expenditure values before testing. Create a new column in the dataset with the transformed values. The R command for the natural logarithm is `log()`. __ \n\n\n\n### Data viz: log-transformed expenditures\n\n__Create density plots and box plots of the log-transformed expenditures stratified by ethnicity. Comment on the distribution shapes. Are there any outliers?__ \n\n\n\n### t-test conditions: log-transformed expenditures\n\n__Are the conditions for a t-test comparing the mean log-transformed expenditures of the two ethnicities satisfied?__ \n\n\n\n### Summary stats: log-transformed expenditures\n\n__Calculate the means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for the log-transformed expenditures stratified by ethnicity, and compare them to the ones in the book. Which group had a larger mean?__ \n\n\n\n### Test\n\n__Run the appropriate statistical test in R to verify the test statistic in the text and get the actual p-value. In which order was the difference in means calculated, and is this same as in the book? Use inline R code to pull these values from the test output when writing up your comparison of these values to the book's values.__ \n\n\n\n### df\n\n__How do the degrees of freedom (df) from the hypothesis test compare to the df used by the book? Why are they different? Which degrees df (book vs. test output) leads to a bigger p-value?__ \n\n\n\n### CI\n\n__What is the 95% CI? Write an interpretation of the CI in the context of the research question. __ \n\n\n\n### Test original expenditure values\n\n__Run the appropriate statistical test in R using the original expenditure values. What are the test statistic and p-value? Does the conclusion of the test change?__\n\n\n\n### CI using original expenditure values\n\n__What is the 95% CI? Write an interpretation of the CI in the context of the research question. Which of the CI's (log-transformed vs not) is easier to interpret?__ \n\n\n\n### Age groups\n\n__The book's example goes on to analyze the data stratified by age groups, since age is a confounder in expenditure amounts. Create two new datasets restricted to the age groups 13-17 and 22-50, respectively.__ \n\n\n\n### Data viz by age groups\n\n__Create density plots and box plots of the expenditures stratified by ethnicity for each of the age groups separately. Comment on the distribution shapes. Are there any outliers?__ \n\n\n\n### t-test conditions: age groups\n\n__Are the conditions for a t-test comparing the mean expenditures of the two ethnicities satisfied for either or both of the age groups?__ \n\n\n\n### Summary stats: age groups\n\n__Calculate the means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for the expenditures stratified by ethnicity and the age groups, and compare them to the ones in the book. Which group had a larger mean?__ \n\n \n\n### t-test: age groups\n\n__Run the appropriate statistical tests for both age groups in R to verify the test statistics, df's, and p-values in the text. In which order were the differences in means calculated, and are they the same as in the book? Use inline R code to pull these values from the test output when writing up your comparison of these values to the book's values.__ \n\n\n\n### CI: age groups\n\n__What are the 95% CI's for each of the age groups? Write interpretations of the CI's in the context of the research question. Does they suggest there are differences in expenditures between the two ethnicities? Why or why not?__ \n\n\n\n### Discrimination in DDS expenditures?\n\n__Even though the p-values for the age-stratified tests were not significant, is it possible that there was discrimination in DDS expenditures?__ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
