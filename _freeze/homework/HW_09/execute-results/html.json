Note that rendering automatically saves your Qmd file and rendering frequently helps you catch your errors more quickly.\n:::\n\n\n# Book exercises {.unnumbered}\n\n## 5.44 Work hours and education {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## 5.46 Child care hours {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## 5.48 True/False: ANOVA, Part II {.unnumbered}\n\n# R exercises \n\n## Load all the packages you need below here. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## R1: Palmer Penguins ANOVA\n\n\n* Use the `penguins` data from the `palmerpenguins` package.\n    * Don't forget to first __install__ the `palmerpenguins` package\n* You can learn more about the Palmer penguins data at <https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/>\n* We will test whether there are differences in penguins' mean bill depths when comparing different species.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\ndata(penguins)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Dotplots\n\n__Make a dotplot of the penguins' bill depths stratified by species type. Include points for the mean of each species type as well as a horizontal dashed line for the overall mean.__ _See example from class for the plot I'm describing._\n\n\n\n\n### Which groups significantly different?\n\n__Based on the figure, which pairs of species look like they have significantly different mean bill depths?__ \n\n\n\n\n### Hypotheses in words\n\n__Write out in words the null and alternative hypotheses.__  \n\n\n### Hypotheses in symbols\n\n__Write out in symbols the null and alternative hypotheses.__  \n\n\n\n### Run ANOVA in R\n\n__Using R, run the hypothesis test and display the output.__  \n\n\n### SST\n\n__Using the values from the ANOVA table, calculate the value of the SST (total sum of squares).__ \n\n\n### MSG & MSE\n\n__Using the values from the ANOVA table, verify (calculate) the values of the MSG (mean square groups) and MSE (mean square error).__ \n\n\n### F statistic\n\n__Using the values from the ANOVA table, verify (calculate) the value of the F statistic.__ \n\n\n### p-value\n\n__Using the values from the ANOVA table, verify (calculate) the p-value.__ \n\n\n\n\n### Decision?\n\n__Based on the p-value, will we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis? Why?__\n\n\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\n__Write a conclusion to the hypothesis test in the context of the problem.__\n\n\n\n### Technical conditions\n\n__Investigate whether the technical conditions for using an ANOVA been satisfied. __\n\n\n\n\n### Post-hoc pairwise t-tests: no correction\n\n__Run post-hoc pairwise t-tests using NO p-value correction. Which pairs of species have significantly different bill depths?__\n\n\n\n\n### Post-hoc pairwise t-tests: Bonferroni correction\n\n__Run post-hoc pairwise t-tests using a Bonferroni correction. Which pairs of species have significantly different bill depths?__\n                \n\n\n### Hypothetical Bonferroni correction\n\n__If _hypothetically_ the p-value comparing the mean bill depths of the Adelie and Chinstrap species were 0.03 without any p-value adjustment, what would the p-value be after running the post-hoc pairwise t-tests using a Bonferroni correction?__\n\n\n\n                \n### Post-hoc pairwise t-tests: Tukey's Honest Significance Test correction\n\n__Run post-hoc pairwise t-tests using Tukey's Honest Significance Test correction. Which pairs of species have significantly different bill depths?__\n\n\n\n### Tukey confidence intervals\n\n__Make a plot showing the 95% family-wise Tukey confidence intervals. How does this plot visually confirm the which pairs of species have significantly different bill depths?__\n\n\n\n",
