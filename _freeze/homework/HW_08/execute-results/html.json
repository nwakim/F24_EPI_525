Note that rendering automatically saves your Qmd file and rendering frequently helps you catch your errors more quickly.\n:::\n\n\n# Book exercises {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## 5.44 Work hours and education {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## 5.46 Child care hours {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## 5.48 True/False: ANOVA, Part II {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## 6.2 Identify relationships, Part II {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## 6.6 Over-under, Part II  {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## 6.10 Guppies, Part I {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\n# R exercises \n\n## Load all the packages you need below here. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## R1: Palmer Penguins ANOVA\n\n\n* Use the `penguins` data from the `palmerpenguins` package.\n    * Don't forget to first __install__ the `palmerpenguins` package\n* You can learn more about the Palmer penguins data at <https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/>\n* We will test whether there are differences in penguins' mean bill depths when comparing different species.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\ndata(penguins)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Dotplots\n\n__Make a dotplot of the penguins' bill depths stratified by species type. Include points for the mean of each species type as well as a horizontal dashed line for the overall mean.__ _See example from class for the plot I'm describing._\n\n\n\n\n### Which groups significantly different?\n\n__Based on the figure, which pairs of species look like they have significantly different mean bill depths?__ \n\n\n\n\n### Hypotheses in words\n\n__Write out in words the null and alternative hypotheses.__  \n\n\n### Hypotheses in symbols\n\n__Write out in symbols the null and alternative hypotheses.__  \n\n\n\n### Run ANOVA in R\n\n__Using R, run the hypothesis test and display the output.__  \n\n\n### SST\n\n__Using the values from the ANOVA table, calculate the value of the SST (total sum of squares).__ \n\n\n### MSG & MSE\n\n__Using the values from the ANOVA table, verify (calculate) the values of the MSG (mean square groups) and MSE (mean square error).__ \n\n\n### F statistic\n\n__Using the values from the ANOVA table, verify (calculate) the value of the F statistic.__ \n\n\n### p-value\n\n__Using the values from the ANOVA table, verify (calculate) the p-value.__ \n\n\n\n\n### Decision?\n\n__Based on the p-value, will we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis?

How does this plot visually confirm the which pairs of species have significantly different bill depths?__\n\n\n## R2: Palmer Penguins SLR\n\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nBelow I frequently use the terminology _variable1 vs. variable2_. When we write this, the first variable is $y$ (vertical axis) and the second is $x$ (horizontal axis). Thus it's always $y$ vs. $x$ (NOT $x$ vs. $y$). \n:::\n\n\n### Scatterplots\n\n* __For each of the following pairs of variables, make a scatterplot showing the best fit line and describe the relationship between the variables.__\n* In particular address \n  * whether the association is linear, \n  * how strong it is (based purely on the plot), and \n  * what direction (positive, negative, or neither).\n\n1. __body mass vs. flipper length__\n\n\n\n2. __bill depth vs. flipper length__\n\n\n\n3. __bill depth vs. bill length__\n\n\n\n### Correlations\n\n* __For each of the following pairs of variables, find the correlation coefficient $r$.__\n\n1. __body mass vs. flipper length__\n\n\n\n2. __bill depth vs. flipper length__\n\n\n3. __bill depth vs. bill length__\n\n\n### Compare associations\n\n __Which pair of variables has the strongest association? Which has the weakest?
