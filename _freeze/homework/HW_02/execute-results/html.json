I especially recommend writing out by hand the chapter 2 probability questions, whether on paper or a tablet.\n* If you complete part of the assignment not using Quarto, you will be uploading 3 files on Sakai for HW 2: qmd & html files for your R work, and a pdf with your written work. \n* If you are completing the homework on paper, you can use a scanning app, such as Adobe Scan, to create a pdf of your assignment.\n:::\n\n* Please upload your homework to Sakai. __Upload both your .qmd code file and the rendered .html file__.\n* For each question, make sure to include all code and resulting output in the html file to support your answers. \n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nIt is a good idea to try rendering your document from time to time as you go along!  Note that rendering automatically saves your Qmd file and rendering frequently helps you catch your errors more quickly.\n:::\n\n\n\n# Book exercises {.unnumbered}\n\n## 1.24 Income and education in US counties {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## 1.28 Mix-and-match {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n## 1.36 Associations {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## 1.38 Smoking and stenosis {.unnumbered}\n*See Section1.6.2 for more on how the relative risk is calculated.*\n\n## 2.6 Poverty and language {.unnumbered}\n\n*Part (b) asks you to create a Venn Diagram.

Based on the patientâ€™s medical history, the probability of having disease 1 is 0.009, having disease 2 is 0.001, and having no disease is 0.99. What is the probability the patient has disease 2 given that they have abdominal pain? \n\n",
