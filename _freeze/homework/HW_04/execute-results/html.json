The Adobe Scan phone app is an easy way to scan photos and compile into a PDF. Please let me know if you greatly prefer to submit a physical copy. We can work out another way for you to turn in homework.\n\nYou can download the .qmd file for this assignment from [Github](https://github.com/nwakim/F24_EPI_525/blob/main/homework/HW_03.qmd) if you want to work in a Quarto doc. **You do not need to work in a Quarto doc for this homework!!**\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nIt is a good idea to try rendering your document from time to time as you go along!
