Note that rendering automatically saves your Qmd file and rendering frequently helps you catch your errors more quickly.\n:::\n\n\n# Book exercises {.unnumbered}\n\n\n## 4.4 Mental health, Part I {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n## 4.6 Thanksgiving spending, Part I {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n## 4.8 Age at first marriage, Part I {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n## 5.6 Working backwards, Part II {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n## 5.10 t⋆ vs. z⋆ {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n## 5.12 Auto exhaust and lead exposure {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n## 5.16 Paired or not, Part II {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n## 5.22 DDT exposure {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n# R exercises \n\n## Load all the packages you need below here. \n\n\n## R1: Youth weights\n\nIn this exercise you will use the YRBSS dataset again that we used in class on Days 8-9, to simulate the distribution of mean weights from repeated samples. \n\n\n### Use the `set.seed()` command to set a randomization seed. Use whatever number you want for the seed.\n\n\n### CI \n\n__Suppose you took a random sample of size 50 from the YRBSS data, that has mean weight 130 pounds. Calculate and interpret a 90% confidence interval using the standard deviation of weights from the YRBSS \"population.\"__\n\n\n### Another CI \n\n__Calculate and interpret a 90% confidence interval assuming the standard deviation of weights from the random sample is 40.__ \n\n\n\n\n## R2: Swim times\n\n* In these exercises you will use R to work through the swim times example from Section 5.2 in the textbook. \n* The data are in the `oibiostats` package and called `swim`.\n\n\n### Mean & SD of differences \n\n__Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the differences in swim times, and compare them to the ones in the book. Which order were the differences calculated, wet suit - swim suit or the opposite? Were all the differences positive?__ \n\n\n### Dot plot of differences\n\n__Create a dot plot of the differences in swim times and comment on the distribution shape.__ \n\n\n### Hypothesis test\n\n__Run the appropriate statistical test in R as both a one-sample t-test and a paired t-test to verify the test statistic, p-value, and CI in the text. Use inline R code to pull these values from the test output when writing up your comparison of these values to the book's values.__ \n\n\n\n",
