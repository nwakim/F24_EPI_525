Once you are used to how regular R Projects work, you can try out a Quarto Project. \n:::\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\n* Many (if not most) of the resources below refer to RMarkdown instead of Quarto files to create reproducible reports. \n* This is not a problem. Projects work the same way with Quarto files. \n:::\n\n\n# Learn more about Projects and why you should *always* be using them\n\nBelow are various resources to learn more about RStudio Projects.\n\n* [RStudio Projects and Working Directories: A Beginner’s Guide](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/01/rstudio-projects-and-working-directories-a-beginners-guide/)\n    * From R-bloggers website\n    * TOC\n        * What is a RStudio Project, and why?\n        * Easy file path referencing with RStudio Projects\n        * Structuring your working directory \n        * Further reading \n* Posit's (RStudio's) directions on creating Projects\n  * [https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects)\n  * This page provides concise directions, but not much motivation on why you should be using Projects. \n* R for Data Science\n    * Excellent book R for Data Science (2nd edition) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund\n    * See Chapter 6 Section 2: Projects (https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts#projects) for \n      * [What is the source of truth?](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts#what-is-the-source-of-truth)\n      * [Where does your analysis live?](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts#where-does-your-analysis-live)\n      * [RStudio Projects](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts#rstudio-projects)\n      * [Relative and absolute paths](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts#relative-and-absolute-paths)\n      * [Summary](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts#summary)\n\n* Jenny Bryant's STAT 545 class notes\n    * Check out Chapter 2 R basics and workflows [https://stat545.com/r-basics.html](https://stat545.com/r-basics.html)\n    * Section 2.2: [Workspace and working directory](https://stat545.com/r-basics.html#workspace-and-working-directory)\n    * Section 2.3: [RStudio Projects](https://stat545.com/r-basics.html#rprojs)\n\n# YouTube videos on how to create an R Project\n\nThis video demonstrates how to create an R Project, and how to open RStudio using the Project file. \n\n* _The Basics of Projects in RStudio_ by Sam Burer  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKoSJGWnFFA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKoSJGWnFFA)\n* _Introduction to RStudio Projects_ by Michael Seaman [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqOme7xsZvs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqOme7xsZvs)\n\n\n",
