Keep the name short and relevant\n2. Use leading numbers to help organize sequential items\n    - I can show you my lessons folders as an example \n3. Use dates in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD\" so that files are in chronological order\n4. You can label different versions if you would like to \n5. Use \"_\" to separate sections of the name\n    - I also use this to separate words, but some people say you should use \"-\" to separate words\n\n## Let's go into `R_activities`\n\n- Make a folder called something like `R04_work`\n\n- We are going to stay in the `R_activities` folder\n\n- Now that we have some folders in order, we can start creating a project\n\n## Creating project in RStudio\n\n-   Way to designate a working directory: basically your home base when working in R\n\n    -   We have to tell R exactly where we are in our folders and where to find other things\n\n    -   A project makes it easier to tell R where we are\n\n-   Basic steps to create a project\n\n    -   Go into RStudio\n\n    -   Create new project for this class (under `File` or top right corner)\n        \n        - I would chose \"Existing Directory\" since we have already set up our folders\n        - Make the new project in the `EPI_525_F24` folder\n\n-   Once we have projects, we can open one and R will automatically know that its location is the start of our working directory\n\n## The nice thing about R projects\n\n- 5 minute video explaining some of the nice features of R projects\n\n<https://rfortherestofus.com/2022/10/rstudio-projects>\n\n\n## Reproducibility\n\n- Research data and code can reach the same results regardless of who is running the code\n\n  - This can also refer to future or past you!\n  \n- We want to set up our work so the entire folder can be moved around and work in its new location\n\n## Nicky's process for R projects\n\n-   Let me show you my process\n\n    -   I will create one in my Sample_folder\n\n    -   I will show you how I switch between classes\n    \n- Make a project file in your class folder!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_57904b81\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:0;bottom:0;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">05</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">00</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## If time, we will move to R05: Intro to Quarto!\n",
