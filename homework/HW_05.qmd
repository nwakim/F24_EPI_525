**Due 11/7/24**

Download the .qmd file for this assignment from [Github](https://github.com/nwakim/F24_EPI_525/blob/main/homework/HW_05.qmd).


## Directions {.unnumbered}

* Please upload your homework to Sakai. __Upload both your .qmd code file and the rendered .html file__.
* For each question, make sure to include all code and resulting output in the html file to support your answers. 


### R & LaTeX code for probability distributions {.unnumbered}

* See the .qmd files with the code from class notes for LaTeX and R code.
* The LaTeX code will make it easier to show your work in computations.

# R exercises 

## Load all the packages you need below here. 


## R1: Youth weights

In this exercise you will use the YRBSS dataset again that we used in class on Days 8-9, to simulate the distribution of mean weights from repeated samples. 


### Use the `set.seed()` command to set a randomization seed. Use whatever number you want for the seed.


### CI 

__Suppose you took a random sample of size 50 from the YRBSS data, that has mean weight 130 pounds. Calculate and interpret a 90% confidence interval using the standard deviation of weights from the YRBSS "population."__


### Another CI 

__Calculate and interpret a 90% confidence interval assuming the standard deviation of weights from the random sample is 40.__ 




## R2: Swim times

* In these exercises you will use R to work through the swim times example from Section 5.2 in the textbook. 
* The data are in the `oibiostats` package and called `swim`.


### Mean & SD of differences 

__Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the differences in swim times, and compare them to the ones in the book. Which order were the differences calculated, wet suit - swim suit or the opposite? Were all the differences positive?__ 


### Dot plot of differences

__Create a dot plot of the differences in swim times and comment on the distribution shape.__ 


### Hypothesis test

__Run the appropriate statistical test in R as both a one-sample t-test and a paired t-test to verify the test statistic, p-value, and CI in the text. Use inline R code to pull these values from the test output when writing up your comparison of these values to the book's values.__
