## Directions {.unnumbered}

[Please turn in this homework on Sakai.](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/EPI-525-1-15028-F24/tool/137d7c54-61a9-4727-9018-374c3773c508) This homework must be submitted using a Quarto document. **Please keep it rendered as an html!** I know past homeworks said pdf, but all Quarto docs should be rendered as html for this class!

You can download the .qmd file for this assignment from [Github](https://github.com/nwakim/F24_EPI_525/blob/main/homework/HW_05.qmd)

:::{.callout-tip}
It is a good idea to try rendering your document from time to time as you go along!  Note that rendering automatically saves your Qmd file and rendering frequently helps you catch your errors more quickly.

## Power and Sample size: Auto exhaust and lead exposure revisited

### Power

In exercise 5.12 in Homework 6, we tested whether police officers appear to have been exposed to a higher concentration of lead than 35. Calculate the power for the hypothesis test and include an interpretation of the power in the context of the research question. Was it sufficiently powered? 



### Sample size

For the same test, what sample size would be needed for 80% power? Would it be reasonable to conduct the study with these sample sizes? Why or why not? (Hint: think about the assumptions of our distributions when using a t-test)


### Effect size

Suppose the study has resources to include 30 people. What minimum effect size would they be able to detect with 85% power assuming the same sample mean and standard deviation. Use $\alpha$ = 0.05. 


## R1: Swim times

* In these exercises you will use R to work through the swim times example from Section 5.2 in the textbook. 
* The data are in the `oibiostats` package and called `swim`.


### Mean & SD of differences 

Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the differences in swim times, and compare them to the ones in the book. Which order were the differences calculated, wet suit - swim suit or the opposite? Were all the differences positive? 


### Dot plot of differences

Create a histogram of the differences in swim times and comment on the distribution shape. 


### Hypothesis test

Run the appropriate statistical test in R as both a one-sample t-test and a paired t-test to verify the test statistic, p-value, and CI in the text. Use inline R code to pull these values from the test output when writing up your comparison of these values to the book's values. 

## R2: 2-sample independent t-test
