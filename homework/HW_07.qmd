## PSS1: Legalize Marijuana, Part III. 

### Power

__<font color="green">In exercise 8.8 (e), we tested whether the proportion of US residents who think marijuana should be made legal is different than 0.586. Calculate the power for the hypothesis test and include an interpretation of the power in the context of the research question. Was it sufficiently powered?</font>__ 




### Sample size

__<font color="green">For the same test, what sample size would be needed for 80% power? How about 90% power?</font>__ 




### Effect size
__<font color="green">If we increase the sample size, and keep the power and significance level the same, does the effect size increase or decrease? Why? </font>__
