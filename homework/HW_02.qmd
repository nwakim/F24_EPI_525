Suppose a patient has abdominal pain and their clinician suspects that they either have disease 1, disease 2, or no disease, where the probability of having abdominal pain if they have disease 1 is 0.80, the probability of having abdominal pain if they have disease 2 is 0.90, and the probability of having abdominal pain if they have no disease is 0.01. Based on the patient’s medical history, the probability of having disease 1 is 0.009, having disease 2 is 0.001, and having no disease is 0.99. What is the probability the patient has disease 2 given that they have abdominal pain?
