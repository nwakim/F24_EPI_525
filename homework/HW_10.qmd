:::{.callout-important}
Below I frequently use the terminology _variable1 vs. variable2_. When we write this, the first variable is $y$ (vertical axis) and the second is $x$ (horizontal axis). Thus it's always $y$ vs. $x$ (NOT $x$ vs. $y$). 
:::


### Scatterplots

* __For each of the following pairs of variables, make a scatterplot showing the best fit line and describe the relationship between the variables.__
* In particular address 
  * whether the association is linear, 
  * how strong it is (based purely on the plot), and 
  * what direction (positive, negative, or neither).

# Nonparametric-Tests


## NPT 1: Sign test

__Vegetarian diet and cholesterol levels__

When covering paired t-tests on Day 10 Part 2, the class notes used the example of testing whether a vegetarian diet changed cholesterol levels. The data are in the file `chol213.csv` at <https://niederhausen.github.io/BSTA_511_F23/data/chol213.csv>. In this exercise we will use non-parametric tests to test for a change and compare the results to the paired t-test.

## NPT 3: Wilcoxon rank-sum test

__Does caffeine increase finger taps/min?__

When covering 2-sample t-tests on Day 11, the class notes used the example of testing whether caffeine increases finger taps/min. The data are in the file `CaffeineTaps.csv` at <https://niederhausen.github.io/BSTA_511_F23/data/CaffeineTaps.csv>. In this exercise we will use a non-parametric test and compare the results to the paired t-test.
