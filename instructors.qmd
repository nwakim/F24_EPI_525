**Brief professor statement:** As a professor, my main goal is to
instill a growth mindset into my students. Growth mindset means we are
NOT stuck in our abilities or knowledge, and that we all can and will
grow! This course aims to be as transparent as possible. I want you to
understand my motivation for assessments, questions, and lessons. I also
want those assessments to be clear, so please ask for clarification
whenever needed.
